## Description


This dataset is a first attempt at collecting socio-cultural-demographic data about contact scenarios, including attempts at quantification as well as qualitative elaborations by respondents.

Respondents were approached as academic collaborators, not as volunteers in an experiment. Respondents were not chosen at random. Respondents were chosen based on their published research and fieldwork experience with either or both Focus and Neighbour language communities.
