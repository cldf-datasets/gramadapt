**Goal**

In this question we wish to know whether language is stated as some kind of emblem of group identity.



**Definitions**

- *Relationships of descent*: A group based on emically defined ways of grouping people who share ancestry and kin. Publications may refer to these groups variously as clans, kinship groups, descent groups, lineage groups, house systems.
- *Race, ethnicity*: A difference based on perceived physical differences, often overlapping with perceived cultural and linguistic differences. Emic commentary on this category often mentions these perceived physical differences, along with identification of difference in some of the following: economic system, wealth, primary subsistence pattern, major staple crop, belief system
- *Local geographical or territorial group*: A group based on local geographical or territorial organization, such as a village, region, neighbourhood, or tribe, but not based on shared ancestry or kinship.
- *Macro-level (politico-)territorial group:* A macro-level group category that supersedes other levels of grouping, such as kin, and local community. The group as a collective has some kind of jurisdictional power, such as exerting punishment for transgressions, and the ability to declare warfare upon other politico-territorial groups.
- *Formal or informal relationships between non-kin*: Identities based on relationship ties rather than those of group membership. Such as alliances, sodality membership, ad-hoc relationships between families or individuals.




**Theoretical & Empirical Support**

Language as a symbolic system is very often utilised as expressions of identity. The ideology of “one language, one folk, one nation” in the creation of the modern nation-state is well documented (XXX). The description of languages as emblems of various macro-social groups is also attested: Pacific, other places etc.



In contrast to the “languages as emblems of identity” situations, we also have documentation where the absence of “language as emblem” is specifically noted. Maya. Africa? Anecdotally, the Maya. Maybe when language is not tied to identity, then there are fewer monitors to affect separation of linguistic codes?



Finally we should note that the kind of “identity” we are talking about it categorical identity, not relational identity.
