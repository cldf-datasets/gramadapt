## E5: How certain are you in your responses for domain X?

- Very certain
- Certain
- Somewhat certain
- Uncertain
- Very uncertain

**Goal**

The purpose of this question is to help us qualitatively assess the degrees of confidence respondents have about this particular social domain. It is also an opportunity for respondents to qualify the responses given in this domain.



There will be a similar certainity assessment at the end of the whole questionnaire, where we ask respondents to assess the certainty of certain sets of questions (i.e. the questions about child socialisation, the questions about language attitudes).
