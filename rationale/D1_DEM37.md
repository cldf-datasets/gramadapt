## D1: Terms of Marriage Exchange - Exchange & Marriage (DEM37)

What type of marriage payments and transfers are expected when Focus Group and Neighbour Group marry? 

- Bridewealth
- Dowry
- Other



**Goal**

Understanding the nature of marriage-related payments and transfers between Focus and Neighbour Group may give us a sense of any power imbalances between the two groups in terms of circulation and accumulation of wealth. The question thus allows us to capture the general complexity of marriage dynamics.



**Definitions**

In most societies, marriage has a big impact on the economy of intermarrying groups. The terms of marriage exchanges contribute to regulate the distribution of property and wealth, and they thus often involve compensatory practices of transfers and payments. These may function as a way of compensating for the displacement of individuals from their groups of origin in to the in-marrying groups, or as a form of support to the newly formed social unit that the marriage exchange creates.

- *Bride price*: The payment/tribute is made by the groom or his family to the bride’s family.
- *Dowry*: A donation of money/household goods that the bride’s parents make to the new family nucleus established by their daughter and her husband. The payment/transfer is usually inherited by the children that the couple may have.
- *Other*: Such as Groom Price (the inverse of Bride Price); bride service (the new husband is required to work for his father-in-law for some time, as a means of compensating for the rights he acquired on his spouse through marriage).




**Examples**

- In southern African societies (e.g. the Zulu), the bride wealth (traditionally called *lobola*) consists of cattle transferring from the groom or the groom’s family to the bride’s father or brother. The payment must be returned in case the marriage does not bear any children and the woman is divorced. If the marriage relationship is ‘successful’, the father can use the cattle to provide wives for his sons, who are in turn expected to return the payment once their first daughter is married. The *lobola* thus establishes debt and a cyclical system of transactions between the parties involved. This is an example of bride price.
- *Dowry*: The practice of dowry was very common in Europe until the 19th century and is still observed in some traditional societies within Europe (e.g. some form of dowry is still practiced in many villages in Sicily, personal knowledge).
- *Other, Groom Price*: Groom Price is common in some East Indian cultures; bride service is documented in the Bible.
