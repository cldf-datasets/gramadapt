## OI3: Is there a codified standard variety for the Focus Group language?


- *yes*
- *no*

**Goal**

In this question we wish to know whether the Focus Group language has a clearly codified standard variety or not.



**Definitions**

The term *codified* refers to rules and standards enshrined in orthography and in an existing corpus, such as holy texts or other important literature.



**Examples**

- The creation of a codified standard variety of French began in earnest in the 16th century. As Latin was slowly being displaced as the main language of reading and writing, “King’s French”, e.g. Parisian French gained prestige. In the period from mid-16th century to the early 17th century, multiple dictionaries, glossaries, and prescriptive grammars were published, and L’Académie Française was established in 1635. In post-Revolutionary France, these works were used as the basis for propagating the standard variety all over the country, at the expense of dialects. Once widespread non-standard languages and dialects have until quite recently been treated with hostility. (Lodge 1993.)
- In Spain, the spread of Castilian as the standard variety is linked to the Reconquista of the Iberian peninsula, which lead to the northern dialect being spread to the south. The codification of Castilian Spanish began in the 13th century and was further solidified by the publication of e.g. prescriptive grammars in the turn of the 16th century. Eventually Castilian became the main language of administration, science, and literature even in Galicia and Catalan-speaking areas and was almost exclusively the language of education. Catalan, and to some extent also Galician, have regained their status as languages used in e.g. literature only from the mid-19th century onwards. (Penny 2002; Burke 2004.)
- The earliest written Finnish in the 16th century was heavily based on western dialects of Finnish and greatly influenced by Swedish, Latin, and to some extent, German orthography. In the 19th century, there were rigorous efforts to purify standard Finnish from Swedish influences, including attempts to remove the grapheme <d> from the written language. During the 19th century,  several features of eastern dialects were accepted in the standard variety, and modern standard Finnish is a compromise between east and west dialectal features. (Nordlund 2012.)




**Theoretical & Empirical Support**

We are interested in standard varieties as they seem to have an effect of flattening community internal linguistic variation. As Lüpke notes, written uses of language "presupposes its standardization" which may accelerate cultural change and loss of "the phatic values of the vernacular" (p.313) resulting in a gradual decline of local languages in what was once a multilingual language ecology. Broucier (2014) demonstrates Standardisation via orthography can lead to speakers adopting utilitarian approaches to language acquisition and use, thereby harming language revitalisation efforts in some communities. Standardisation by definition means making things similar across parameters, and there is ample evidence from across the world where standardisation via orthography results in the loss of linguistic diversity.
