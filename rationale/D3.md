## D3: Social categories

**Goal**

This question seeks to identify social categories that likely form distinct communities of practice within the larger societal context. Put another way, we are interested in identifying emically relevant social groups which may play a role in domain-internal linguistic variation. Here, we use the term “communities of practice” to broadly refer to a group of people connected to one another by partaking in similar activities and/or states of being. By doing so we acknowledge the socially constructed and culturally specific nature of social categories (such as gender, ethnicity), as well as acknowledging that these social categories are social practices.



We are interested in the existence of these salient social categories for a few reasons. Firstly, identifying emically relevant social categories gives us a chance to identify possible subnetworks of people within a speech community and domain. Contact situations would affect subnetworks differently, in that a single speech community experiences contact heterogeneously. For example, contact between Finnish speakers and speakers of L1 varieties of English in the domain of work is likely to be concentrated towards white-collar and other upper-middle socio-economic networks, while contact between Finnish speakers and Kurdish speakers would cover a different demographic. The complexity of social networks in any given contact situation means that there are various pathways through which linguistic innovations can diffuse (or not) through the wider speech community. Emically salient social categories often seem to be good candidates for identifying the social patterning of linguistic variation within a community. By identifying possible subnetworks, we may get a better picture of how linguistic consequences of contact may or may not diffuse through to the wider speech community.



Ideally we would want respondents to identify those social categories that are known or thought to affect linguistic production in the Focus Group (i.e. socially condition linguistic variation). However since it is unlikely that such data are available for many communities, we are going to make an evidence-based assumption that the mere emic identification of social categories makes it likely that linguistic variation and differentiation may occur along these lines. Thus we have *a priori* chosen the social categories in the possible responses with the understanding that these social categories have been found to relate to linguistic variation in various communities around the world.

**Examples**

*Sex*: What qualifies as “Yes” in this context are more extreme situations in which the possibilities of linguistic interaction between sexes in a given social domain are highly constrained from the perspective of sociocultural practices and conceptualisations thereof. For instance, in traditional Muslim societies, possibilities of interaction between men and women across social domains are shaped by the practice of classifying people of the opposite sex as those with whom marriage is forbidden (*mahram*, e.g. a woman’s father and brother) and those with whom marriage is permitted (*na-mahram*). Social and linguistic interactions with the latter group are highly constrained by this distinction across all social domains (e.g. in trade or in the neighbourhood space): “Places, both at home and in the neighbourhood, where one is likely to encounter, meet, and interact with *na-mahram*people become defined as restricted spaces for both women and men” (Mazumdar & Mazumdar 2001: 304).



For example, [in many society women were excluded from receiving formal education / the types of work that people are involved in differ, depending on their caste/ people of differing social classes hang around in different social circles centred around different activities]. In order to qualify for a “yes” answer, the social category group should be emically significant enough to potentially have some linguistic consequences, even if it is limited solely to the people of that group (e.g. monks have their own extensively used lect which has little linguistic effect on the wider community).



We would say for contemporary London, the social categories of “class”, and “race/ethnicity”, affect a person’s experience of commerce in the city. That is, the types of commerce opportunities and situations that an upper-class person engages in would be different to that of a lower-class person; the commerce opportunities and situations are different for Anglo-British, and peoples of East Asian, South Asian, and Caribbean heritage.



**Theoretical & Empirical Support**

*Hierarchy associated with profession and wealth such as class and caste:* Class has been a staple of variationist sociolinguistic investigation since Labov (1966).



*Magico-religiously sanctioned group such as caste and religious denomination*: Variation in Arabic between Jews and Muslims of North Africa (Jastrow 1990 cited in Germanos & Miller 2015), variation between Sunni and Shia Bahrainan Arabic (Holes 1987; 1995; 2006). See Spolsky (2003) for review on religion and language contact.



*Relationships of descent*: Clan as a variable in South Western China (Stanford 2009a), paternal heritage predicting variation in Murrinh Patha (Pama-Nyungan; Australia) (Mansfield 2015).



*Group of land ownership:*



*Race, ethnicity, or some other kind of grouping:* Whiteness in the USA (Bucholtz 2010).



*Age cohort, life stage*: Labov's model of how to interpret age from sociolinguistic corpora (1994). Summary Sankoff 2004. Takano (to appear?) has found in the case of Japanese, that the production of morphosyntax and segmental phonology remain stable in post-adolescet years, but vocabulary items and prosody (e.g., lexical accents) were likely to change. Age-cohort and variation studies of English varieties: Cheshire (1982), Romaine (1984), Andersen (2001). Language variation and change across the life-span:  Wagner 2012.



*Place identity and affiliation:* see Low & Lawrence-Zúñiga, 2003; Johnstone, 2010 from the perspective of sociolinguistics.



*Other:* Youth cultures, subcultures, and other communities of practice more broadly
