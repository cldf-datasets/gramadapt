## DFK09: What language do Neighbour Group people typically speak with their Focus Group spouse? 

- *The Focus Group language*
- *The Neighbour Group language*
- *Some other language*
- *This is highly contextual*

**Goal**

This question has the same goals as those of CID I2; that is, this question is asking about the input a Focus Group person receives from Neighbour Group people. In this instance we are specifically interested in the input from one's Neighbour Group spouse.

We may surmise that if a Focus Group are exposed to the Neighbour Group language through this domain, they will have opportunities to comprehend or produce the Neighbour language. It is also an indirect measure of asymmetries characterising the contact situation. For instance, if, on average, Neighbour Group people are likely to use the Focus Group language in interactions with Focus Group people, this can be an indication of contextual and/or more fundamental asymmetries in the social dynamics between the two groups within the contact situation at stake.

**Definitions**

(If you choose “The Focus Group language” or “Some other language” skip question 16.)

_This is highly contextual_: includes instances of code-switching between one's own language and their spouses' language.

**Theoretical and empirical support**

Cross-linguistic marriages have various consequences for language contact, especially if they are frequent enough to register as not uncommon in a community. Bilingual families can result in bilingual children in some contexts, where the input of two languages contribute to a child's bilingual development. In some communities such as the Nmbo speakers of Papua New Guinea, adult women may learn their spouses' languages once they marry into their household as adults. (Kashima 2020)

Of course levels of input are one of many factors that affect language contact outcomes. Additional factors such as post-marital residence and language attitudes for example also shape language choice within marriages (e.g., Epps 2018; Stanford and Pan 2013; summary Pakendorf, Dobrushina, and Khanina 2021 for small-scale multilingual communities; Potowski 2013 for urban contexts). In communities where language shame is attached to languages identified as "out-group", children can abandon the active production of their maternal language (e.g. in Sui speaking southern China ala Stanford 2009a; Kaveh & Lenz 2021 for children of racially minoritized immigrants in the USA). The levels of input would be one factor that contributes to the configuration of bilingual practices of individuals and communities.
