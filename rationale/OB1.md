## OB1: Is there an emic conception of Focus Group as “a language” or some other categorical or objective thing? 

- *Yes*
- *No*



**Goal**

This question intends to identify whether a group conceptualises ways of speaking a certain way as a reified "language". 



**Definitions**

emic = a locally understood; as perceived by community insiders



**Examples**

A prototypical example of language ideologies of reification are nationalist linkages between language, nation, and people.

Reification of languages are also attested non-nationalist frames of meaning. Pakedorf et. al (2021) have noted that linguistic reification in small-scale multilingual societies is often spatially and/or politically anchored (p.839). A local place may be viewed as having a language, or being strongly associated with a  language. Either way there appears to be some kind of imagined idea of (a) way of speaking.  




**Theoretical Support**

Particular uses of the notion translanguaging take the theoretical stance that bilinguals who speak/sign multiple languages have an internally undifferentiated and unitary linguistic system, therefore that  ‘languages’	have no linguistic or cognitive reality (as pointed out by Cummins 2021 and others). Many argue that this is empirically untrue. For example an fMRI study by Abutelebi et al. (2008) demonstrate that German-French bilingual speakers mobilise different areas of the brain in order to inhibit the effects of the other language when speaking one. As Cummins (2021) points out, there appears to be a conflation of fluidity in utilising multilingual repertoires in practice, with the idea that this reflects a cognitive reality: "The hybridity	of linguistic practices	and the	complexity	of linguistic repertoires	‘do	not	carry	the	consequence that languages	do	not	exist	or that	named	languages	are	irrelevant’ (Grin,	2018:	257)."

The lack of cross-linguistic investigation into the question of whether communities objectify ways of speaking (as "languages" or something similar) prompted us to include this question in the questionnaire.
