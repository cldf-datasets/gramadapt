# Local Community

This domain concerns the surroundings closest to the household environment, but outside the realm of family and kin. In modern societies, the local community space coincides somewhat with the notions of a “private sphere” and captures social ties such as friendships and acquaintances, where unmonitored speech likely occurs. Within this space, we are interested in capturing face-to-face interactions between both individuals and groups.

By local community we mean a space of interaction, which is not necessarily bounded to a geographical place. This is done in order to capture mobile groups (e.g. nomads) and other communities of practice. Examples of local community vary depending on type of residential and living arrangements. They include things like neighbourhood, band or village.

For some contact situations, the domains of local community and labour will overlap significantly. If local community and domain of labour are one and the same, please answer for both domains.


**Goal**

Here we wish to understand what kind of interactions occur between Focus Group and Neighbour Group people in the contexts closest to the household environment, but outside the realm of family and kin. Within this space, we are interested in capturing face-to-face interactions between both individuals and groups where so-called "unmonitored speech" is likely to occur.

For some societies, the domains of local community and labour will overlap significantly. If local community and domain of labour are one and the same, please answer for both domains.


**Definition**

Local Community: Domain concerning the surroundings closes to the household environment, but outside the realm of family and kin. A space of interaction that may extend beyond a bounded geographical place (this is done in order to capture mobile groups (e.g. nomads) and other communities of practice.

Unmonitored speech: Ways of speaking where speakers are paying less attention to the forms they produce, compared to situations where they do (such as formal situations). Overlaps somewhat with notions of "vernacular speech".


**Examples**

- Neighbourhood
- Band
- Village
- We expect examples of local community to vary depending on type of residential and living arrangements. 


**Theoretical & Empirical Support**

Given that unmonitored speech is identified as a likely locus of linguistic innovations (cf. Labov 1966; 1972, and his definition of ‘vernacular speech’), we wish to investigate the local community as a space where this kind of informal interactional registers are likely to be used. For example, it has been suggested that in diglossic situations, the “low” variety, which tends to be used in contexts associated with the ‘private sphere’ is often left unmonitored, and, thus, open to more interference and contact effects (Sayahi 2007: 48). By using the label ‘unmonitored speech’, we thus wish to capture a variety of speech styles that are typically connected with interactions beyond family and kin, but within the realm of the private sphere, which, in our definition, coincides with the space of the local community. Examples of these unmonitored speech styles are sociolects, dialects, as well as registers related to different communities of practice etc.
