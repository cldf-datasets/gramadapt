## OL3: Do Focus Group people use some orthography in writing their language?



**Goal**

Asking about orthography gives us a sense of degrees in literacy. Asking about standardised orthography gives us a sense of how centralised the society is.



**Definitions**

*Orthography* refers to any writing system.

- *Yes, in a non-standardised way:* language is written but there is no standardised way of writing and there is a lot of variation in how people use orthography.
- *Yes, in a standardised way:* language is written and there is a standardised way of writing available, but there may still be some variation in to what extent people write in a standardised way.
- *No, the Focus Group language is not written:* language is not written at all, or it may be written but writing in the Focus Group language is very rare and sporadic.




**Examples**

- Rotokas (North Bougainville, Papua New Guinea) uses Latin script. Ethnologue lists the literacy rate of both L1 and L2 Rotokas speakers as 50–75%.
- North Saami (Uralic; Norway, Sweden, Finland) uses Latin script. A spelling reform made in 1979 resulted in a “pan-Scandinavian” orthography, meaning that the language is to be spelled the same way irrespective of the political nation where it is written (Östman 2011: 367). Ethnologue lists the literacy rate of L1 North Saami speakers as 30–60% and L2 speakers as 75–100%.
- Huichol (Uto-Aztecan; Mexico) uses Latin script. Ethnologue lists the literacy rate of L1 Huichol speakers as 5–10% and L2 speakers as 5–15%.
- Halh Mongolian (Mongolic; Mongolia, Russian Federation) uses both Cyrillic and Mongolian script. Mongolian script was used prior to 1941 and again since the 1990s. According to Ethnologue, also Phags-pa script and Tibetan script were previously in use.
- Lao (Kra-Dai; Laos) uses Lao script. Ethnologue lists the literacy rate of L1 speakers as 30–60% and L2 speakers 50–75%.
- Gujari (Indo-European; India, Pakistan, Afghanistan) uses primarily the Nastaliq variant of Arabic script. According to Ethnologue, also Devanagari script is used and there are plans for future development of using Devanagari to write the language. Ethnologue lists the literacy rate of L2 speakers as 5–15%.
