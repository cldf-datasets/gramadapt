## OL3: Do Focus Group people use some orthography in writing their language?



**Goal**

Asking about orthography gives us a sense of degrees in literacy. Asking about standardised orthography gives us a sense of how centralised the society is.



**Definitions**

*Orthography* refers to any writing system.

The scale is as follows:
- *Yes, in a non-standardised way:* language is written but there is no standardised way of writing and there is a lot of variation in how people use orthography.
- *Yes, in a standardised way:* language is written and there is a standardised way of writing available, but there may still be some variation in to what extent people write in a standardised way.
- *No, the Focus Group language is not written:* language is not written at all, or it may be written but writing in the Focus Group language is very rare and sporadic.




**Examples**

The following examples are from The Ethnologue (Eberhard, Simons & Fennig 2023) unless otherwise specified.
- Rotokas (North Bougainville, Papua New Guinea) uses Latin script. The literacy rate of both L1 and L2 Rotokas speakers is 50–75%.
- North Saami (Uralic; Norway, Sweden, Finland) uses Latin script. A spelling reform in 1979 resulted in a "pan-Scandinavian" orthography, meaning that the language is to be spelled the same way irrespective of the state where it is written (Östman 2011: 367). The Ethnologue lists the literacy rate of L1 North Saami speakers as 30–60% and L2 speakers as 75–100%.
- Huichol (Uto-Aztecan; Mexico) uses Latin script.The literacy rate of L1 Huichol speakers is 5–10% and that of L2 speakers 5–15%.
- Halh Mongolian (Mongolic; Mongolia, Russian Federation) uses both Cyrillic and Mongolian script. Mongolian script was used prior to 1941 and again since the 1990s. According to The Ethnologue, also Phags-pa script and Tibetan script were previously in use.
- Lao (Kra-Dai; Laos) uses Lao script. The literacy rate of L1 speakers is 30–60% and that of L2 speakers 50–75%.
- Gujari (Indo-European; India, Pakistan, Afghanistan) uses primarily the Nastaliq variant of Arabic script. Also Devanagari script is used and there are plans for future development of using Devanagari to write the language. The literacy rate of L2 speakers is 5–15%, but no figures are reported for L1 speakers. It appears that literacy rate of L1 speakers is fairly low: even in villages with education (which is unusual), fewer than half of the males and hardly any females had received any schooling (see Losey 2002: 6-7 and references there).
- Adang (Timor-Alor-Pantar; Indonesia) does not have a standard orthography. Children seem to be mostly educated in Indonesian (Haan 2001; Hamilton et al. 2013: 18). Literacy rate appears low but no figures are available.
