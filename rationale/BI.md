## BI: What language do Focus Group people expect to be used when interacting with Neighbour Group people in domain X?



The Focus Group language The Focus Group language

The Neighbour Group language The Neighbour Group language

Some other language Some other language

This is highly contextualThis is highly contextual



**Goal**

This question tells us about stated norms around language use in specific social domains. The stated norm around language use may be reflections of various linguistic ideologies.



The answer to this question is treated as one of a number of factors that play a role in characterising language ideologies. This factor alone is likely unable to characterise the socio-cultural environment of language use. In combination with other socio-cultural factors, this variable may be indicative of differences in power (imagined or real), ideologies of linguistic homogeneity, and/or ideologies of linguistic differentiation.



**Definitions**

- *The Focus Group language/The Neighbour Group language/Some other language*: So-called monolingual modes of interaction. These options are mutually exclusive, that is, if more than one language is used in interaction, please select the fourth option, "This is highly contextual”.
- *This is highly contextual*: encompasses interaction in which more than one language is used, including but not limited to phenomena that come under the umbrella terms "code-switching" and/or "code-mixing".




**Examples**

- *This is highly contextual*: Di Carlo, Good & Ojon Diba (2019) note that different social domains often require different multilingual modes in multilingual communities of rural Africa. For example, monolingual patrimonial language may be prevalent in ritual performances like communications with shrines or ancestors, while contexts like the home do not require the use of particular languages and “present unconstrained multilingual contexts” (ibid.: 18). The family and kin domain would beget a “This is highly contextual” answer in this questionnaire, while the ritual domain would be one of the other options.
- *Knowledge Domain:* The use of Sanskrit in the “precosmopolitan period” of India was monopolised by ritual specialists such as the Āryas, and its use in domains outside the sacred were prohibited (Pollock 2006: 40). Pollock notes that in the Common Era while Sanskrit was used in liturgical, literary, and political discourse at the highest level, the norm was that the business of land or village tended to be conducted in non-Sanskrit languages (ibid.: 49). This distinction of languages by social domain may be taken as a reflection of ideologies where non-Sanskrit languages are associated with local and earthly concerns, while Sanskrit is not.




**Theoretical & Empirical Support**

This question about stated language norms is an attempt to capture a small dimension of language ideologies within the contact scenario under investigation. Language ideologies have been argued as behaviour affecting beliefs that have consequences for social and linguistic structures (Gal & Irvine 1995; Woolard 2020), and has been argued as a particularly relevant factor for outcomes of language contact. There are noticeable cases where ideologies of language and group differentiation seem to help keep certain linguistic structures distinct (Gal & Irvine 1995). For example in the linguistically diverse Northwestern Amazon, Chernela (2013) describes how the devaluing of one's matrilect by East Tukanoan speakers makes spoken bilingualism very rare (though passive bilingualism is prevalent, as well as receptive multilingual interactions).
