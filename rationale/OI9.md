## OI9: What are the Focus Group speakers' attitudes towards lectal differences within the Focus Group language?



**Goal**

The purpose of this question is to gain general characterisation of the Focus Group speakers' attitudes to language internal variation.



Positive attitudes towards lectal differences may have different outcomes. One possibility is that positive attitude towards lectal differences creates openness towards linguistic transfer from another language. But because positive attitudes towards lectal differences may also be closely connected with group identity, it is possible that they will instead create opposition towards linguistic transfer from other languages. Because these issues are unclear it is relevant to try answering these questions to the extent possible.



**Definition**

The term *lectal differences* refers here to different accents, dialects, and sociolects.

The scale of answers is as follows:
- *Very negative*: lectal differences are frowned upon and there may be discrimination or prejudice against speakers of certain lects.
- *Neither positive nor negative*: neutral attitude towards lectal differences, no clear opinion, indifference.
- *Very positive*: lectal differences are appreciated and highly valued perhaps as emblems of local identity.



**Theoretical & Empirical Support**

Language attitudes may play an important role in people's linguistic behaviour both in terms of language change at a general level and in terms of language contact situations. With question BA we have asked about the Focus Group people's overall attitude towards the Neighbour Group people in different social domains. With question OI6 we have asked about the Focus Group speakers' attitudes towards linguistic transfers from the Neighbour Group. Both these questions probe language attitudes in situations of language contact. With this question OI9, we ask about the Focus group people's attitude toward lectal differences within the Focus group. This question is thus not directly asking about attitudes towards any contact-related phenomenon.

However, language attitudes towards group-internal lectal differences may also play an important role in people's linguistic behaviour in situations of dialect or language contact. For instance, positive attitude towards language-internal variation, such as lectal differences, may suggest greater openness towards linguistic transfer from other languages as well. For instance, the Uto-Aztecan Western Mono people valorize language-internal diversity and this attitude is part of a more general linguistic ideology which also puts value on multilingualism. This ideology has also resulted in widespread borrowing (Kroskrity 2023). In contrast, the Tewa people (Kiowa-Tanoan) have a linguistic ideology that could be characterized as indigenous purism: the Tewa language plays a crucial role for their group identity whereby there is also a strong push to linguistic orthodoxy and standardization (Kroskrity 2023). As a result, The Tewa language has only a few borrowings from other languages. Opposite trends are possible as well, such as a positive attitude towards lectal differences being a strong factor for group identity, which would might create opposition towards linguistic transfer from other languages.
