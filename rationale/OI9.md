## OI9: What are the Focus Group speakers' attitudes towards lectal differences within the Focus Group language?



**Goal**

The purpose of this question is to gain general characterisation of the Focus Group speakers' attitudes to language internal variation.



Positive attitudes towards lectal differences may have different outcomes. One possibility is that positive attitude towards lectal differences creates openness towards linguistic transfer from another language. But because positive attitudes towards lectal differences may also be closely connected with group identity, it is possible that they will instead create opposition towards linguistic transfer from other languages. Because these issues are unclear it is relevant to try answering these questions to the extent possible.



**Defintion**

The term *lectal differences* refers here to different accents, dialects, and sociolects.



- *Very negative:* lectal differences are frowned upon and there may be discrimination or prejudice against speakers of certain lects.
- *Neither positive nor negative:* neutral attitude towards lectal differences, no clear opinion, indifference.
- *Very positive:* lectal differences are appreciated and highly valued perhaps as emblems of local identity.
