## D6: Post-Marriage Residency Practices (DFK35, DFK39)

e.g. What is the typical pattern of relocation for Focus Group women when starting a new family? 

- Focus Group women practically always relocate to Neighbour Group locations 
- Focus Group women often relocate to Neighbour Group locations 
- Focus Group women sometimes relocate to Neighbour Group locations 
- Focus Group women rarely relocate to Neighbour Group locations 
- Focus Group women practically never relocate to Neighbour Group locations 


**Goal**

This question is related to post-marital residential practices. While there are a variety of residential practices that exist in the world, for the purposes of this questionnaire we look at patrilocal practices vs other forms.



**Definitions**

*Patrilocal post-marital residency pattern*: where a wife moves to be with the husband once married.



**Examples**

- *Focus/Neighbour Group women practically always relocate at Neighbour/Focus Group location*: Tariano (Arawak; Brazil/Colombia) speaking women who marrying Wanano (Tucanoan; Brazil/Colombia) speaking men will live in their husband’s village (Chernela 2013). Idi (Pahoturi River; Papua New Guinea) speaking women who marry Nen (Yam; Papua New Guinea) speaking men will live in their husband’s village (Evans 2012).
- *Focus Group women sometimes relocate to Neighbour Group locations:* These answer options may include cases of matrilocality where the husband relocates (e.g. Hopi (USA), Eggan 1950), or ambilocality where the husband pays conjugal visits to his wife in her household/village (e.g. Na (Sino-Tibetan; China) speakers used to practice *tisese* “walking back and forth” visiting system where husbands would pay conjugal visits to their wives households and villages (Shih 2010; c.f. Stanford et al. 2018))




**Theoretical Support & Examples**

The reason for looking at patrilocal practices vs. other forms is twofold. Firstly, it appears that the most common pattern of post-marital residence pattern after marriage is where a wife moves to be with the husband or husband’s mother’s brother’s household (862/1267 = 68% according to the variable EA011: “Transfer of residence at marriage: prevailing pattern” at D-Place,[ ](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fd-place.org%2Fparameters%2FEA011%231%2F30%2F153&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw3WCgnCost3m5e1-G6plcxX)[https://d-place.org/parameters/EA011#1/30/153](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fd-place.org%2Fparameters%2FEA011%231%2F30%2F153&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw3WCgnCost3m5e1-G6plcxX)).



Secondly, sociolinguistic descriptions from parts of the world with high levels of linguistic diversity and multilingualism note how women marrying into a community that “does not speak her language” will have children who have some kind of multilingual capacity. There are reports of children with passive multilingualism (Sui, China as described by Stanford 2009a; 2009b), receptive multilingualism (Mawng speakers in Yolngu-matha Australia, Singer 2018), active multilingualism in Nen and Idi (Papua New Guinea, Evans 2012). Researchers analyse the language ideologies of the community as largely affecting the multilingualism of children. These ideologies appear to be associated with the geographical location of residence (e.g. a child should speak the language of their patriline and patrilineal place as in the Sui case; a woman should speak the language of her husband’s place as in the Papua case). The suggestion from such research is that the wife-to-husband relocation plays a role in creating/maintaining a linguistic environment that fosters multilingual speech on a daily basis.
