## T7: What language do Focus Group parents typically speak with their children? (DFK20)

- The Focus Group language
- The Neighbour Group language
- Some other language
- This is highly contextual


**Goal**

This question seeks to understand what languages Focus Group parents may speak with their children. The goal is to examine and understand family language practices in situations of language contact and multilingualism with an eye towards transmission across generations.



**Definitions**

- *The Focus Group language/The Neighbour Group language/Some other language:* So-called monolingual modes of interaction. These options are mutually exclusive, that is, if more than one language is used in interaction, please select the fourth option, "This is highly contextual”.
- *This is highly contextual:* encompasses interaction in which more than one language is used, including but not limited to phenomena that come under the umbrella terms "code-switching" or "code-mixing.


- *Mixed-speech:* speech that combines various codes (languages/language varieties) used at varying degrees in the speech. The speech is not purely one language nor another rather a combination of codes. Mixed-speech can alternately be referred to as “code-switching” or “code-mixing”.
- *Parent:* For this study, we define the parent as the guardians or adults who are the primary caretakers of the child. We look to understand family linguistic practices better, and thus it is crucial to understand the input children receive from their primary caregivers. In addition, we recognize that family practices vary across communities/cultures. For these reasons, we want to clarify that the adults responsible for taking care of a child on a day-to-day basis will be considered the *parents*in these contexts.


**Theoretical & Empirical Support**

Consider the following scenario, a home environment consisting of an Okinawan-speaking, Focus Group parent and a Japanese-speaking, Neighbour group parent together with their child(ren), where Okinawan language is in contact with Japanese.

*This is highly contextual:* Located at the southernmost tip of Japan, one finds the Ryukyu Islands. This region is administratively divided into the Okinawa Prefecture and the Kagoshima Prefecture. The Okinawa Prefecture is a collection of 160 islands where the Okinawan language is in contact with Japanese. The Okinawan language has numerous regional dialects, some of which are mutually intelligible (Maretzki & Maretzki 1966: 370). Research collected by Thomas and Hatsumi Maretzki during 1954-55 states that Okinawa was “spoken in all households” and that “the first words learned by the child from his mother or others around him are in Okinawan” (ibid.: 370) at the time. Recent research reveals that intergenerational transmission of Okinawan has continually dropped since the 1950s, and Japanese has increasingly been the first language of those born after the 1950s (Heinrich 2007; 2016).

Nowadays, Ryukyuan residents are immersed in a language ecology including variants of Okinawa, Standardised Japanese and English. Residents possess varying degrees of competency in these languages. Heinrich’s research (Heinrich et al. 2009) shows that the questionnaire results from 2005 and 2006 reveal that the vitality of the Okinawa language is not promising as an astonishingly low level of residents address children in the local language. Decades-long language shift from Okinawa toward Japanese has increased what Heinrich explains as a mixed-speech variety. Mixed-speech is increasingly used across family-kin relationships (defined as spouses, children, parents, grandparents, neighbours, and colleagues). The middle generation (30-60 years of age) uses it more than the older generation (60-90 years of age), and an even further increased usage is reported among the younger generation (0-30 years of age) where the mixed speech is used across almost all domains (Heinrich 2007)**.**Intergenerational transmission decreased drastically since the 1950s which left those born after with a low command of Okinawa. This makes it increasingly difficult for parents to pass on the local language and even more so to use it in the home if the Japanese-speaking parent does not possess a command of the local language.

Furthermore, Heinrich’s research (2015) reveals that despite parents possessing a competency in Okinawan, it is reported that only 64% use it “rarely” or “not at all” with only 8% reporting using it “often” and 28% “sometimes”. The research clearly shows that Okinawan-speaking parents are increasingly choosing not to intergenerationally transmit Okinawan to their children. Those of child-bearing age will likely speak this mixed Okinawan-Japanese speech as opposed to speaking to their child in only Okinawan or only Japanese. When an Okinawan-speaking parent’s speech toward their child reflects that of “mixed speech”, the most appropriate answer to this question would be “This is highly contextual”.
