## O1: What language do Focus Group people typically speak when interacting with Neighbour Group people?

- The Focus Group language

**Goal**

This question is trying to get a sense of what languages are actively spoken by Focus Group people, within the contact situation at stake.



The possible answers have been designed in order to account for the fact that linguistic interactions across time and space are often multilingual, and that multilingual interactions manifest themselves in a variety of ways, ranging from the use of a third-party language, receptive multilingual communication and contextually-governed switches between the languages shared by the people involved in interaction and within the contact situation at stake.



**Definitions**

- *The Focus Group language/The Neighbour Group language/Some other language*: So-called monolingual modes of interaction. These options are mutually exclusive, that is, if more than one language is used in interaction, please select the fourth option, "This is highly contextual‚Äù.
- *This is highly contextual*: encompasses interaction in which more than one language is used, including but not limited to phenomena that come under the umbrella terms "code-switching" and/or "code-mixing".
