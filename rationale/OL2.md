## OL2: Ability to read and write in terms of social categories

Is the ability to read and write restricted, in practice to people of:

(Answer Yes/No to the following)
- Group associated with profession or wealth, such as class and caste: key criteria here are hierarchy and associated with profession. Example: Feudal European divisions, such as nobility and serf.
- Magico-religiously sanctioned groups, such as religious denomination: a group whose existence and powers are justified based on spiritual/divine/non-human foundations and/or creed. Examples: the clergy, Hindu caste system, ceremonial groups, Sunni and Shia muslims.
- Descent groups, such as clan, house, lineage group, kinship group: a group based on emically defined ways of grouping people who share ancestry and kin.
- Races, ethnicities, or other similar groupings: a difference based on perceived cultural and linguistic differences. Choose "yes" only if emic commentary on this category mentions perceived physical differences along with identification of difference in one of the following: economic system, wealth, primary subsistence pattern, major staple corn, belief system.
- Age cohorts or life stages: social category related to life stages, such as pre-initate, teenage-hood, unmarried, community elder. We are not asking if there is evidence of age-conditioned variation (i.e. change in progress) but if there are emically salient cohorts which arguably form some kind of community of practice.
- Sex or genders: choose "yes" only if one's assigned gender severely restricts access to literacy. For example, if women are excluded from learning to read and write, choose "yes".
- Other


**Goal**

This question seeks to identify social categories that likely form distinct communities of practice in terms of literacy. Put another way, we are interested in identifying emically relevant social groups which are likely to play a role in linguistic variation related to access to literacy. Here, we use the term communities of practice (CoP) to broadly mean a group of people connected to one another by partaking in similar activities and/or states of being. By doing so we acknowledge the socially constructed and culturally specific nature of social categories, such as gender and ethnicity.

We are interested in identifying salient community-internal social categories in order to identify possible subnetworks of people within a speech community. It is plausible that contact situations affect these subnetworks differently instead of contact situations and contact processes spanning a single community homogeneously. For example, contact between Finnish speakers and speakers of "L1 varieties of English" in the domain of work is likely to be concentrated towards white collar and other upper-middle socio-economic networks, while contact between Finnish speakers and Kurdish speakers would cover a different demographic.This complexity of social network means there are various pathways through which linguistic innovations related to access to literacy can diffuse through the wider speech community (or not). Emically salient social categories are also often good candidates for identifying the social patterning of linguistic variation within a community. By identifying possible subnetworks, we may get a better picture of how linguistic consequences of contact may or may not have diffused through to the wider speech community.

Ideally we would want respondents to identify those social categories that are known or thought to affect linguistic production related to literacy (i.e. socially conditioned linguistic variation related to access to literacy). However since it is unlikely that such data are available for many communities, we are going to make an evidence based assumption that the mere emic identification of such social categories makes it likely that linguistic variation and differentiation related to literacy would occur along these lines.

We have a priori chosen the social categories in the possible response with the understanding that these social categories have been found to relate to linguistic variation in some way. We assume these social cateogries may be relevant in relation to linguistic variation related to access to literacy as well. We do not know as a field whether these linguistic consequences are markedly different across these different social categories (i.e. that the social conditioning of race begets markedly different linguistic change outcomes compared to the social conditioning of religion affiliation), but we would not assume this to be the case. These social categories would manifest in locally specific ways, and it would be those broader social and cultural contexts that would probably shape the trajectory of linguistic change and diffusion of change within the community anyway.


**Definitions and examples**

This question asks whether there are any restrictions in access to literacy in terms of social categories. The question has seven binary subquestions, each question related to a specific group/social category.

The following groups are identified:
- *Group associated with profession or wealth, such as class and caste*: key criteria here are *hierarchy* and *associated with profession*. Example: Feudal European divisions, such as nobility and serf.
- *Magico-religiously sanctioned groups, such as religious denomination*: a group whose existence and powers are justified based on spiritual/divine/non-human foundations and/or creed. Examples: the clergy, Hindu caste system, ceremonial groups, Sunni and Shia muslims.
- *Descent groups, such as clan, house, lineage group, kinship group*: a group based on emically defined ways of grouping people who share ancestry and kin.
- *Races, ethnicities, or other similar groupings*: a difference based on perceived cultural and linguistic differences. Choose "yes" only if emic commentary on this category mentions perceived physical differences *along with* identification of difference in one of the following: economic system, wealth, primary subsistence pattern, major staple corn, belief system.
- *Age cohorts or life stages*: social category related to life stages, such as pre-initate, teenage-hood, unmarried, community elder. We are not asking if there is evidence of age-conditioned variation (i.e. change in progress) but if there are emically salient cohorts which arguably form some kind of community of practice.
- *Sex or genders*: choose "yes" only if one's assigned gender severly restricts access to literacy. For example, if women are excluded from learning to read and write, choose "yes".
- Other communmity of practice.
