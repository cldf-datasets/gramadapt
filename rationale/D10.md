## D10: Do Focus Group people experience domain X differently depending on social group?

Free text answer.

**Goal**

This question aims to elicit an assessment of the social categories and/or communities of practices that are thought to be particularly relevant to contact in this social domain. It is related to question D3 concerning social categories.

This question is here in recognition of the fact that not all members of a speech community engage in contact, and that contact experiences differ, in part, based on oneâ€™s social background. The answers to this question will help us interpret the answers to the rest of the questionnaire, and which group of people the answers apply to. The answers to this question will also help provide a more nuanced picture of the socio-cultral particularities of a given contact scenario. The answers to this question may also potentially be relevant to understand whether contact-induced linguistic variation and change are likely to rise and spread in this domain.

See D3 for details on social categories.
