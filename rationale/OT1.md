## OT1 (P2): How long have Focus Group and Neighbour Group people interacted in domain X?

Give an approximate year range.

**Goal**

Testing for linguistic adaptation presumes an understanding of the contact situation before the present, since it is the sociohistorical context of the past which may have led to changes in language structures that are visible today. However, given the challenges in generalising across the time-depth of contact scenarios worldwide, this questionnaire refrains from establishing any a priori chronological cut-off points for the contact situations we study.

**Definitions**

We attempt to study the relevance of time in a bottom-up fashion by asking respondents to perform two tasks.

1) To make an assessment of the duration of contact between Focus Group and Neighbour Group in a given social domain (this question);
2) To identify the time frame of densest contact between Focus Group and Neighbour Group in that social domain (P3) in the past. 

Once the time frame is identified, the respondent should answer the remaining questions from this time frame's perspective, for the domain in question.

The assessment of the duration and density of contact may include the contemporary situation in the following instances:

(a) if it is the only time setting the respondent can answer for,
(b) if the contemporary situation represents a continuation of contact in the past.
