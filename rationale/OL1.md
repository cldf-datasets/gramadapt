## OL1: What is the approximate rate of formal literacy in the Focus Group community?

(in the questionnaire this question is formulated as: "What is the approximate rate of formal literacy in the Focus language speaking community?")


**Goal**

The purpose of this question is to get an approximate sense of how prevalent literacy is for the total population of the Focus Group language speakers.



**Definitions**

Literacy can be grouped into formal and functional literacy.
- *Formal literacy* refers minimally to knowing the orthography and being able to read simple texts familiar to the reader but potentially still with problems in understanding.
- *Functional literacy* refers to the ability of reading and understanding a range of different kinds of texts that are new to the reader, and to the ability of writing.


Please answer from the perspective of *formal literacy.*


The scale is as follows:

*Low:* a small minority of members of the language community (roughly 20% or less) are literate.

*Fairly low:* a minority of members in the language community (roughly 20–40%) are literate.

*Intermediate:* roughly half of all members in the language community (roughly 40–60%) are literate.

*Fairly high:* the majority of members in the language community (roughly 60–80%) are literate.

*High:* an overwhelming majority of members in the language community (roughly 80% or more) are literate.



**Theoretical & Empirical Support**

High rate of literacy is a fairly recent development in human history. Before mass education in modern societies, high rates of formal literacy across social groups occurred mostly in the Nordic countries, where the dominant Lutheran societal norms required people to learn to read (e.g., Sinnemäki et al. 2019). High rates in writing skills have been even less common before modern times. Some exceptions to these trends do exist, but they tend to be limited to certain social groups, such as to soldiers of the ancient Roman empire (e.g., Speidel 2018; Tomlin 2018).

There is some evidence suggesting that the ability to read and write may affect individual's cognitive processing. For instance, research in cognitive and experimental psychology suggests that acquiring the association between a phoneme and a corresponding visual symbol alters the way that oral second language is processed at least in tasks that demand awareness of linguistic segments (Tarone 2010). Illiterate adults appear to be strong in tasks related to syllable segmentation and rhyming, but weaker than literate adults in tasks related to phonemic segmentation (e.g., Tarone & Bigelow 2005).

Literacy may also affect the units of language processing in both children and adults and the subsequent learning of particular grammatical patterns (see e.g. Havron 2017). Learning from multiword units benefits both adults and children in learning, for instance, grammatical agreement, because agreement domains stretch over multiple words. However, children seem to prefer to learn from larger linguistic units compared to adults (e.g., Havron & Arnon 2021). As a result, children's learning outcomes seem to be better in learning grammatical agreement compared to noun learning, which focuses on learning single words. This difference in multiword vs. single word learning disappears when children learn to read and focus more on single written words separated from one another via spaces.
