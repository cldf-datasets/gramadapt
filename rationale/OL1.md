## OL1: What is the approximate rate of formal literacy in the Focus Group community?



**Goal**

The purpose of this question is to get an approximate sense of how prevalent literacy is for the total population of the Focus Group language speakers.



**Definitions**

- Literacy can be grouped into formal and functional literacy. *Formal literacy* refers minimally to knowing the orthography and being able to read simple texts familiar to the reader but potentially still with problems in understanding. *Functional literacy* refers to the ability of reading and understanding a range of different kinds of texts that are new to the reader, and to the ability of writing.




Please answer from the perspective of *formal literacy.*



The scale is as follows:

*Low:* a small minority of members of the language community (roughly 20% or less) are literate.

*Fairly low:* a minority of members in the language community (roughly 20–40%) are literate.

*Intermediate:*roughly half of all members in the language community (roughly 40–60%) are literate.

*Fairly high:* the majority of members in the language community (roughly 60–80%) are literate.

*High:* an overwhelming majority of members in the language community (roughly 80% or more) are literate.



**Theoretical & Empirical Support**

High rate of literacy is a fairly recent development in human history. Research in psychology has shown that acquiring skills in literacy changes the way oral second language is processed (Tarone 2010). This applies at least to alphabetical orthographies. Literacy may also affect the units of language processing in both children and adults (Havron 2017). Literate second language learners may also have certain learning styles that are different to those who are illiterate (ADD referenece). Literacy skills may thus have an effect on language use as well, and more importantly, in the context of bi- or multilingualism.
