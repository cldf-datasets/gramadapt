## T9: What language do children typically speak with their Focus Group parent? (DFK22)

- The Focus Group language

- The Neighbour Group language

- Some other language

- This is highly contextual



**Goal**

This question seeks to understand what languages children speak with their Focus Group parents. The objective is to examine and understand family linguistic practices in multilingual, language contact contexts with an eye towards transmission across generations.



**Definitions**

- *The Focus Group language/The Neighbour Group language/Some other language:* So-called monolingual modes of interaction. These options are mutually exclusive, that is, if more than one language is used in interaction, please select the fourth option, "This is highly contextual”.
- *This is highly contextual:* encompasses interaction in which more than one language is used, including but not limited to phenomena that come under the umbrella terms "code-switching" and/or "code-mixing".Syncretism: In terms of linguistics, syncretism refers to the copresence of two codes in a speech used by a speech community. This can be both inter-and intrasentential code-switching (Makihara 2004: 532).
- *Parent:* For this study, we define the parent as the guardians or adults who are the primary caretakers of the child. We look to understand family linguistic practices better, and thus it is crucial to understand the input children receive from their primary caregivers. In addition, we recognize that family practices vary across communities/cultures. For these reasons, we want to clarify that the adults responsible for taking care of a child on a day-to-day basis will be considered the parents in these contexts.
- *Syncretism:* In terms of linguistics, syncretism refers to the co-presence of two codes in a speech used by a speech community. This can be both inter-and intrasentential code-switching (Makihara 2004: 532).




**Theoretical & Empirical Support**

Consider the following scenario, a home environment consisting of a Rapa Nui-speaking Chilean, Focus Group parent and a continental Spanish-speaking Chilean, Neighbour group parent together with their child(ren) on Easter Island.



*This is highly contextual:* The Rapa Nui- speaking community of Easter Island, Chile has been facing language shift towards Spanish over the past several decades. Essentially all island residents speak Spanish, and about 30% speak Rapa Nui at varying degrees of fluency. The influx of non-Rapa Nui speakers in the past century has changed the linguistic dynamic. After the growth in mainland migration, Spanish became the primary language of interaction across domains. The family and kin domain has been heavily affected by an increase in continental Chileans arrival to the island during the mid-1900s (Makihara 2005a).

Makihara's research on Rapa Nui speech found that some Rapa Nui parents speak to their pre-verbal children in Spanish baby talk and will often address their speech-competent children in Spanish in one-on-one interaction, suggesting that a shift is occurring. Even when an adult addresses children in Rapa Nui, children instinctively respond in Spanish. Many children have obtained a passive knowledge of Rapa Nui with Spanish as the dominant language. The shift toward Spanish has been accelerated in part due to intermarriages between Continentals and local Rapa Nui. Despite the clear preference toward Spanish in the recent decades, the local Rapa Nui have displayed a desire to reclaim their language and cultural identity through syncretic speech patterns (Makihara 2005b). Syncretic speech is marked by features of both languages. Although the speech is neither purely Spanish nor purely Rapa Nui, there is an intention to place features of both codes into their speech patterns. If an utterance is not understood when initially addressed under a certain language (be it Spanish or Rapa Nui), the syncretic variety will often be used to repeat the phrase (Makihara 2005b: 745-755).

In this type of situation, where children’s language choices with their Focus Group parents tend to include more than one code resembling syncretic speech, the most appropriate answer to this question would be “This is highly contextual” despite Spanish language dominance.
