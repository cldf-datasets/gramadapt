## BH: How do Focus Group people view themselves overall in relation to Neighbour Group people, within the context of domain X?

- Very superior
- Superior
- Neither superior nor inferior
- Inferior
- Very inferior



**Goal**

This question aims to investigate whether there are any attitudes or beliefs present in this domain that may reflect inequalities in power. We frame the question around senses of superiority and inferiority to get to notions of “prestige” that are often invoked in discussions of language convergence and shift in particular.



**Examples**

- *Very superior*: Clearly stated beliefs that the Focus Group are better than the Neighbour Group in some way.
- *Superior*: Some stated beliefs that Focus Group are better than the Neighbour Group in some way.
- *Neither superior nor inferior:* e.g. there are no clear or obvious stated beliefs that Focus Group are better than the Neighbour Group in some way.
- *Inferior*: Some stated beliefs that Focus Group are not as good as the Neighbour Group in some way.
- *Very inferior*: Clearly stated beliefs that Focus Group are not as good as the Neighbour Group in some way.




**Theoretical & Empirical Support**

Studies on language choices often utilise the concept of prestige as a motivating factor. A general finding is that people often use languages, varieties, and styles that help them access the prestige associated with that language.



What is prestigious, however, manifests itself differently across social contexts. For example, there is the valuing of prestige associated with formal institutions of power, often called *overt prestige*. Labov’s (1972) seminal “fourth floor” department store study of New Yorker English is a classic demonstration of speakers accessing overt prestige. Another example is the use of English in traditionally non-English speaking countries. “English is perceived as a language of developed Western countries” by young educated Kazakhs and the use of English is associated with identification with the West (Akynova et al. 2014: 229).



In contrast, the notion of *local prestige* revolves around values that may be particular and distinct to those around overt prestige(1). Local prestige may emphasise localness in direct opposition to standard varieties (e.g. Coupland & Bishop 2007 on various expressions found across the UK), they may be an expression of community root and ties (e.g. Ventsel & Struchkova 2015 on Sakha in the Republic of Sakha, Russia), or even linguistic expression of resistance (e.g. Spanish heritage-language learners’ appropriation of high- and low-prestige varieties in the USA, Lefkowitz & Hedgcock 2016).



What seems to unify both forms of prestige is some stated belief around “better vs lesser” hierarchy judgement.



The notion of prestige appears to be present in contexts where there is some kind of perceived hierarchy, or when there is some social stratification in a society (this is rarely spelled out explicitly, but seemingly implied, e.g. Grusky 2015 in an encyclopaedia entry about social stratification). We have chosen the general terms “superiority and inferiority” as the dimension to tackle prestige. Given that the notion of prestige is a belief, we ask about possible hierarchy in terms of the subjective assessment of superior vs inferior.



In this questionnaire we treat overt prestige as one of the many factors that affect the use of certain linguistic variants and codes in any given context. Coming back to the example of Kazakhstan, Akynova et al. (2014) also note that among the ways to use English by the young Kazakhs whom they investigated are insertion strategies to save time and provide specific meanings which cannot be expressed in Kazakh or Russian (ibid.: 231); that is, prestige is just one reason for young Kazakhs to speak English.



[^1] As Meyerhoff (2011: 41–42) points out, the traditional notion of *covert prestige* as put forward by Trudgill (1972) is different to that of local prestige. Trudgill’s use of covert prestige refers to the mismatch between the stated ideals around language varieties versus what speakers were actually producing in speech. For example, a English speaker from Norwich states that local pronunciations of certain words are “better” than the Standard Southern British realisations, but in unmonitored speech would produce the Standard realisation. This, Trudgill argues, is evidence of covert prestige. In this questionnaire we have chosen not to consider this form of covert prestige, since we predict there are few studies that will have such evidence for the speech communities in our sample.
