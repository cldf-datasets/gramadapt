## OG1: What is the population density within the territory controlled by the Focus Group community?

(NOTE: In the questionnaire this question is stated as "OG1: What is the population density within the area where the Focus Language is spoken?")


**Goal**

This question seeks information about population density.



**Definitions**

Underlyingly this question requires data about the number of speakers/users of the Focus Language and the approximate size of the area where the Focus Language is used. Population density is then estimated by dividing population size by the geographical area: $d_density = {N_population}/{A_area}$. See feature OD1 for the Total number of native speakers; the geographical area was estimated by the respondents, but sometimes the density was estimated from available documents (see the Comments to the responses).

This question and possible answers are adapted from the question [SCCS64](https://d-place.org/parameters/SCCS64#2/14.3/151.2) in the Standard Cross-Cultural Sample (Murdock & White 1969; Murdock & Wilson 1972) and the question [WNAI288](https://d-place.org/parameters/WNAI288#4/46.38/240.03) in the Western North American Indian database (Jorgensen 1980). Both features are available in D-Place (Kirby et al. 2016; 2018c; 2018d); they can be accessed by clicking the links above.

The scale is as follows:

*Less than 2 persons per 10 sq. km*

*2-4 persons per 10 sq. km*

*5-19 persons per 10 sq. km*

*20-99 persons per 10 sq. km*

*100-399 persons per 10 sq. km*


Note that here the unit for geographical area is *10 square kilometres* (km^2) instead of *1 km^2*. For some minority language groups population density is smaller than one person per km^2, which is why we opted expressing population density in larger units. In the D-Place the unit is square mile (one square mile equals roughly 2.6 square kilometres).



**Examples**

The following examples from D-Place illustrate different population densities and how we translated them into our five-point scale.
- The entry for [Mescalero society](https://d-place.org/society/WNAI154) (Mescalero-Chiricahua Apache, Athabaskan-Eyak-Tlingit; United States of America) lists the population density as less than 1 person per 5 square mile. This population density translates to roughly less than 1 person per 13 square kilometres, which falls into our Category 1: less than 2 persons per 10 square kilometres.
- The entry for [Shuar society](https://d-place.org/society/SCCS169) (Shuar, Chicham; Ecuador) lists the population density as 1 person per 1–5 square miles. This population density translates to roughly 1 person per 1-13 square kilometres, which falls into our Category 2: 2–4 persons per 10 square kilometres.
- The entry for [Blin society](https://d-place.org/society/SCCS38) (Bilin, Afro-Asiatic; Eritrea) lists the population density as 1–5 persons per square mile. This population density translates to roughly 1-5 persons per 2.6 square kilometres, which falls into our Category 3: 5–19 persons per 10 square kilometres.
- The entry for [Gitxan society](https://d-place.org/society/WNAI6) (Gitxan, Tsimshian; United States of America) lists the population density as 5–25 persons per square mile. This population density translates to roughly 5-25 persons per 2.6 square kilometres, which falls into our Category 4: 20–99 persons per 10 square kilometres.
- The entry for [Palauans](https://d-place.org/society/SCCS111) (Palauan, Austronesian; Palau) lists the population density as 26–100 persons per square mile. This population density translates to roughly 26-100 persons per 2.6 square kilometres, which falls into Category 5: 100–399 persons per 10 square kilometres.



**Theoretical & Empirical Support**

Population density seems to encourage innovations of different kinds; this suggests the rate of language change depends on population density (Bromham et al. 2015).
