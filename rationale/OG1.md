## OG1: What is the population density within the territory controlled by the Focus Group community?



**Goal**

This question seeks information about population density.



**Definition**

This question and possible answers are adapted from the question SCCS64 in the Standard Cross-Cultural Sample (Murdock & White 1969; Murdock & Wilson 1972) and the question WNAI288 in the Western North American Indian database (Jorgensen 1980). Both features are available in D-Place (Kirby et al. 2016; 2018c; 2018d; see [https://d-place.org/parameters/SCCS64#2/14.3/151.2](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fd-place.org%2Fparameters%2FSCCS64%232%2F14.3%2F151.2&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0bPldVJJZvTsnT5BTeOSJG); [https://d-place.org/parameters/WNAI288#4/46.38/240.03](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fd-place.org%2Fparameters%2FWNAI288%234%2F46.38%2F240.03&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw1htbfSBe_scQRX18lurgFk)).



The scale is as follows:

Less than 2 persons per 10 sq. km

2-4 persons per 10 sq. km

5-19 persons per 10 sq. km

20-99 persons per 10 sq. km

100-399 persons per 10 sq. km



**Examples**

- The entry for Mescalero society (Mescalero-Chiricahua Apache, Athabaskan-Eyak-Tlingit; United States of America) in D-Place lists the population density as less than 1 person per 5 square mile, which falls into Category 1: less than 2 persons per 10 square kilometres.
- The entry for Shuar society (Shuar, Chicham; Ecuador) in D-Place lists the population density as 1 person per 1–5 square miles, which falls into Category 2: 2–4 persons per 10 square kilometres.
- The entry for Blin society (Bilin, Afro-Asiatic; Eritrea) in D-Place lists the population density as 1–5 persons per square mile, which falls into Category 3: 5–19 persons per 10 square kilometres.
- The entry for Gitxan society (Gitxan, Tsimshian; United States of America) in D-Place lists the population density as 5–25 persons per square mile, which falls into Category 4: 20–99 persons per 10 square kilometres.
- The entry for Palauans (Palauan, Austronesian; Palau) in D-Place lists the population density as 26–100 persons per square mile, which falls into Category 5: 100–399 persons per 10 square kilometres.




**Theoretical & Empirical Support**

Population density seems to encourage innovations of different kinds; this suggests the rate of language change depends on population density (Bromham et al. 2015).
