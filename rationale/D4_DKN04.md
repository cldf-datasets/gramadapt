## D4: Additional Domain Information - Knowledge (DKN04)

The relationship between Focus Group and Neighbour Group in the domain of knowledge can typically be characterised as:



- Focus Group people are masters,  Neighbour Group are novices
- Neighbour Group people are masters, Focus Group are novices 
- None of the above 



**Goal**

In this question we wish to identify whether Focus Group people tend to occupy a position of authority in terms of knowledge transmission. Here we are concerned with the status of recognised knowledge bearer, rather than the exact nature of the knowledge (e.g. religious knowledge, magic and sorcery, histories etc.)



**Definition**

- *Masters*: knowledge bearers, teachers, instructors etc.
- *Novice*: recipient of knowledge, student, apprentice, congregation members, etc.




**Examples**

- *None of the above*: For example, situations where Focus Group and Neighbour Group are equally likely to be in master or novice positions
- None of the above: For example, situations where both Focus Group and Neighbour Group tend to be novices, and masters are from another group.

  

**Theoretical & Empirical Support**

The main rationale for this question is based on the following understanding: when a group of people tend to be recognised as masters and bearers of knowledge, these people and their symbols are likely to be associated with authority. This authority has consequences for linguistic behaviour.



Clear instances can be seen of the power associated with masters of knowledge, in relation to language standardisation in the nation state. Specifically, a lot of research has been conducted in the realm of language management and a myriad of consequences from such policies (cf. Spolsky & Lambert 2006). In general, teachers appear to believe that language management is possible. Formal education, whether it be language instruction or other parts of the curriculum, enforces the use of a standard. This has often resulted in the reduced prestige of other languages and varieties; most acutely visible in colonial contexts (e.g. Giv√≥n 1971 for Africa)



Related to this notion of power and influence, it appears that standardised language, and religious language, are highly monitored for linguistic deviations. Writing about sacred languages in general, Fudge (2006: 526) notes that priests who are charged with conducting worship and ceremonial events often need to learn archaic phonological forms of a language. In nationalistic contexts with standardised varieties, there are often accompanying purist beliefs that have strong ideological oppositions to use of foreign languages (Kroskrity 1998). While this question is not specifically looking at notions of language purity, the likelihood that such ideologies increase if a group of people tend to be held up as authorities in the realm of knowledge. Correspondingly, if a group tends to occupy the position of novice, we may assume their authority is low (or non-existent).
