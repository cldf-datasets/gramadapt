## T1: How much do Focus Group children participate in domain X?

- They practically always participate

**Goal**

This question aims to capture the extent to which interactional dynamics in this domain affect transmission. By asking whether children actively participate in the activities typical of this domain, and by crosschecking this information with the data we gather on interactions between Focus and Neighbour Group in this domain, we try to get a sense of whether the domain provides an opportunity for children to learn the Neighbour Group language or other linguistic codes other than “their own”.
