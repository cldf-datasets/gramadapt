## E1: List any other groups that the Focus Group interacted with in the past, in so far as you believe this had linguistic consequences for the Focus Group language. Where possible, please also give an indication of when this happened.



**Goal**

We are interested to know about intuitions concerning other sources of language contact in the domain of trade in the past.



**Example**

If Focus Group are Estonians of Tallin, and Neighbour Group is Russian: we know that German speaking Hansa traders interacted with Estonian speakers, and there are many German loan words that can be traced to this period of trade. In which case, we would list other group/language as “German Hansa traders” and the linguistic consequence as “loan words”.
