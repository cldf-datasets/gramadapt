## OD3: What is the number of native-like users of Neighbour Group language?



**Goal**

In this questionnaire we collect data on the number of native speakers so that we can correlate it with other sociolinguistic factors, such as density of social networks (S6/7). Our purpose is to test, for instance, Trudgill's hypothesis that linguistic complexity is affected by several sociolinguistic factors in tandem, including community size, and social network density, as well as Reali et al.'s (2018) simulation result that population size affects ease vs. difficulty of diffusion within populations.



**Definition**

- The term *native-like speakers* encompasses two types of people. First, it refers to those members of the language group who have learned the Focus Group language as the first language. Second, it refers to those members of the Focus Group who have learned the language since childhood and their competence in the language is comparable to first language learners.




This question and possible answers are adapted from question SCCS1122 in the Standard Cross-Cultural Sample (Murdock & White 1969; White 2009) that is available in D-PLACE (Kirby et al. 2016; 2018c; see[ ](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fd-place.org%2Fparameters%2FSCCS1122%232%2F14.3%2F151.3&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw1NJpvOgywMgSIE-c9pxyKK)[https://d-place.org/parameters/SCCS1122#2/14.3/151.3](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fd-place.org%2Fparameters%2FSCCS1122%232%2F14.3%2F151.3&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw1NJpvOgywMgSIE-c9pxyKK))



**Theoretical & Empirical Support**

Number of native speakers has been used in many recent studies in language typology and psycholinguistics (e.g. Lupyan & Dale 2010; Sinnemäki & Di Garbo 2018; Raviv et al. 2021). Some researchers, such as Lupyan & Dale (2010), use it as a proxy for language contact effects. The justification for doing that is the hypothesis that the greater the speech population of a language is, the more likely it is also being learned as a second language by outsiders. Based on typological data this hypothesis may be incorrect, because population size does not seem to correlate very strongly with, for instance, the proportion of second language speakers in the community (Sinnemäki & Di Garbo 2018). Peter Trudgill (2004; 2010; 2011) has argued that instead of using population size as a sole predicting factor of typological variation, it should be considered instead together with density of social networks and the amount of language contact in the community. Sinnemäki & Di Garbo (2018) provide initial evidence substantiating this claim typologically. Raviv et al.'s (2021) experimental study further show that community size in itself does not affect learnability of morphological complexity, but Raviv et al.'s (2019) study suggest that large communities may create more systematic languages. In addition, community size seems to be in a complex relationship with social network structure and mechanisms of transmission within the network, as suggested by computer simulations on cumulative cultural evolution (Cantor et al. 2021).



However, there may be some room for considering population size as a meaningful factor on its own, too. Population size seems to affect the rate of language change in that large populations gain words more rapidly, while small populations lose words more rapidly (Bromham et al. 2015; Greenhill et al. 2018).
