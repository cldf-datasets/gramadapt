## D9: Kin-Talk (DFK38)

Are any of the following features characteristic when speaking to one’s Neighbour Group in-laws? 

- Lexical avoidance
- The use of certain morphosyntactic forms
- The use of certain pronominal forms 


**Goal**

This question gives us a sense of whether affinal registers are practiced in the contact situation at stake.



**Examples**

*Lexical Avoidance*

- Proper name avoidance. The avoidance can extend to homophones of near-homophones (e.g. avoiding words that sound like an in-law’s name (e.g. Datooga (Nilotic, Tanzania), see Mitchell 2015). These can be segmentally based, syllable based (e.g. Kataamba, Ethiopia, see Fleming 2014)). We have not found examples yet, but we would include any semantically based reasons for avoiding lexical items in this group.
- Avoidance of certain lexical items in the presence of in-laws (e.g. described as “mother-in-law languages” in Australia, see Dixon 1971; McGregor 1989). The avoidance can extend to homophones and semantic associations.
- Avoidance of certain pronominal forms (e.g. Aslian languages, see Kruspe & Burenhult 2018)




*Unique morphosyntactic forms*

- Including kinship verbs (cf. Evans 2000, Iroquian languages, Yuman languages, some Australian languages)
- Bear Lake Athapaskan verbal inflections are marked by stem changes, and “the affinal forms of these verbs are not the dual or plural forms” (Rushforth 1981: 33)




*Pronominal forms*

- Pronominal forms that are not unique to an affinal register e.g. use of third person pronominal forms (e.g.), plural pronominal forms (e.g. Korowai, Stasch 2009: 86), vocative forms (some Aslian languages, Kruspe & Burenhult 2018)


**Theoretical & Empirical Support**

Affinal relationships stand out in documentary works as relationships that affect linguistic behaviour (King 2001; Blythe 2013; Evans 2012). There are often strong social obligations between in-laws, which seems to result in strong imperatives for audience design and stance taking. For example lexical avoidance is a cross-culturally observed behaviour in this domain (see Merlan 1981 for an overview in Australia; Garde 2014 for Bininj Gunwok (Gunwingun; Australia); Mitchell (2015; 2018) for Datooga (Nilotic; Tanzania), and Stasch 2011 for Korowai (Awyu-Dumut; West Papua)). The use of special address terms and registers is also noted for these relationships (see e.g. Kruspe & Burenhult 2018 for Aslian languages), pronominally and verb agreement morphology in Dhimal (Tibeto-Burman, see King 2001), Rushforth (1981) on pronominal forms in Dane-Zaa (Athabaskan; Canada)).



At the time of writing we are not aware of studies concerning affinal register and linguistics outcomes of contact. But language change phenomena that emerge from kinship registers have been attested, for example, in parts of Australia. Blythe (2013) describes the diachronic development of kin-based morphosyntax in Murrinh-Patha.
