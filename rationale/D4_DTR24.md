**Goal**

The aim of this question is to find out whether money is used in trade, or not.



**Theoretical & Empirical Support**

The use of money, and monetary systems for trade, tell us a few things. For instance, currencies tend to be used by groups that are part of larger and highly stratified societies (check), which in turn suggest certain kinds of interactions and linguistic exchanges. Secondly, Experimental evidence suggests that the use of cash results in more solitary and individualistic behaviours (Vohs et al. 2006), which may in turn have consequences for interactions and linguistic norms. The use of currencies raises the possibility of interaction between strangers. If a group mostly barters, this type of exchange probably involves intimates (although barter can co-exist alongside the use of money (Davies 2002: 11â€“13)). If anything other than money is involved, more linguistic interaction is probable. Cash economies may also involve much negotiation but cash economy allows the possibility of reduced linguistic interaction.
