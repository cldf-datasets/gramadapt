## P1: Is domain X a relevant domain of contact between Focus Group and Neighbour Group?

**Goal**

This question first establishes whether the social domain is a locus of social contact between the Focus Group and Neighbour Group. If there is no social contact in this domain, respondents will skip this portion of the questionnaire.



**Definition**

For the purposes of this project, language contact is defined as *social contact* in a broad psychological and socio-cultural setting (Weinreich 1953). Language contact is a phenomenon that occurs in interactions between individuals who are bi- or multilingual to varying extents. In other words, both the individual speaker and their socio-cultural context are requisites for language contact. We follow the understanding that bilingual speakers are at the heart of any given contact scenario (Myers-Scotton 2002; Matras 2009; Muysken 2013; Li & Zhu 2013; Winford 2013; de Bot & Bülow 2020). Additionally, we view bilingual speakers as active participants in their socio-cultural environments (Aikhenvald 2007; Pfänder & Siegel 2015; Yakpo 2020).
