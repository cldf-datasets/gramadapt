## D1: Domain Detail - Knowledge (DKN02)

The most influential form of knowledge in this contact scenario is:

- Global
- Local



**Goal**

This question intends to identify some cursory characterisation about the most influential form of knowledge in the contact scenario. The major distinction is whether that knowledge is part of a larger and shared community of practice beyond the immediate area, or whether it is not.



**Definitions**

- *Global*: The knowledge is shared by people outside the region, and is shared in relatively distant areas. Bearers of this knowledge should have such an awareness, and an awareness as practitioners of a larger community of practice
- *Local*: contrast against “global knowledge”. Local knowledge is unique to the area or region, shared by people in a comparatively local area (e.g. shamanic practices). Components of the practice or belief system may have its origins from other regions, but bearers of this knowledge understand the knowledge to be localised.




**Examples**

- *Global*: world religions, Arabic numeral mathematics, Chinese medicinal practices
- *Local*: Historical practices of shamanism as discernable from historical texts. Northern shamanism, defined as a “worldview system” with associated beliefs, practices, and paraphenelia (Pentikäinen 1996: 10), is found across the arctic and subarctic parts of the world. But northern shamanism manifests in different ways in different parts of the north, and touches on “ecology, economy, social structure” etc. For example, Manchu-Tungusic peoples of north East-Asia have both a concept and a word for shaman, while the Khanty (Russia) have similar phenomena but no word or concept to bind it in a similar way (ibid.). In other words, while shamanism as a phenomena can be characterised at a macro-areal level with many parallels, we would characterise it as predominantly a local phenomena grounded in the environments and lives of particular groups.




**Theoretical & Empirical Support**

This question reflects the skew in publications concerning language and education: namely that the religions and education systems being researched are associated with expansionist phenomena such as colonisation. Thus many case studies and claims about language change and religion focus overwhelmingly on Eurasian world religions, noticeably of Christianity (summary by Spolsky in Omoniyi, Fishman & Spolsky 2006). Case studies on education, and language policy studies, also appear to be in the context of superseding localised forms of knowledge and communication; often with a colonial or nationalising agenda (for a summary, see Spolsky & Lambert 2006). The aim of this question is to identify whether the influential form of knowledge in the contact scenario may fit these kinds of scenarios. In other words, we are using "global" and "local" as proxy labels for "knowledge system of large and areally diffused group" and "local" for "knowledge system of small and geographically localised group".



At the stage of writing, we as a project are not familiar with what language change phenomena are attributed to the practices of localised forms of knowledge. The only forms that come to mind are investigations of lexicon of specialised domains such as ethnobotanical knowledge, often in the context of cultural endangerment (e.g. Carlson 2001). In cases where knowledge systems of larger groups brush up against knowledge systems of localised groups, it seems that there is a threat of localised knowledge being lost (however there are also cases of precarious but successful intergenerational transmission, e.g. ethnobotanical knowledge of Ngunnuwal and Yuin people of Australia (Heaney et al. 2020).
