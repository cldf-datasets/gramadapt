## D1: Endogamic Rules - Exchange & Marriage (DEM27)

When marrying each other, should Focus Group people and Neighbour Group people marry somebody from:When marrying each other, should Focus Group people and Neighbour Group people marry somebody from:



the same village or other kind of local community?

the same descent group or clan?

the same designated marriage group, such as a moiety?

the same hierarchical social group such as class or caste?

the same linguistic group?



**Goal**

This question elicits different types of endogamic rules.



**Definitions**

*Endogamic rules* specify with whom marriage is encouraged or prescribed.



The options listed in the question correspond to the following types of endogamic rules.

- *Village endogamy*: Marriage partners must come from the same village. Geographic boundaries are used to reinforce boundaries between social groups.
- *Descent group endogamy*: Marriage partners must come from the same descent group. This is typically done through parallel-cousin marriage, i.e. marriage between the offsprings of two brothers (in a patrilineal type of descent).
- *Caste endogamy*: Marriage partners must come from the same caste. These are hereditary social divisions by which such things as ownership, occupation, political position and ritual status are defined.
- *Class endogamy*: Marriage partners must come from the same socioeconomic class, a type of social stratification which is typically defined on the basis of wealth, occupation and/or level of education.
- *Linguistic endogamy*: Marriage partners must come from the same linguistic group (as defined emically)




**Examples**

- *Village endogamy* patterns have been observed in rural Turkey. Stirling (1965) studied two rural Turkish villages, Elbasi and Sakaltutan, and noted a ratio of every two women marrying an resident of their natal village to every one who marries out. In both of these villages, the level of in-marriage among women residing in the village was over 60%. (Stirling 1965; Schwimmer 1995–2003.)
- *Descent group endogamy.* This pattern is common in Middle Eastern societies, both in contemporary Arab communities and in ancient Israel. The Old Testament describes parallel cousin marriage in many instances. (Schwimmer 1995–2003.)
- *Caste endogamy* is widespread in traditional Indian societies. The Nayar (East India) occupy a high rank in the local caste system. They marry within the caste or with higher castes, such as the Brahmins. They are however forbidden from marrying or engaging in sexual partnership with people from the lower ranking castes. (Schwimmer 1995–2003.)
- *Class endogamy* is quite widespread in contemporary Western societies. Blackwell (1998) analysed marriages in the United States and noticed a strong tendency for people two choose marriage partners with similar educational background. In addition to education, also religion affects marriage patterns in the United States (Schwimmer 1995–2003).
- *Linguistic endogamy* has been documented in the Amazonian Vaupés region, where the Hup, Yuhup, and Kakua peoples mostly practice linguistic endogamy with clan exogamy (Epps 2018).




**Theoretical & Empirical Support**

Rules of endogamy contribute to define group identity, status, and power dynamics between neighbouring groups. They thus reinforce and define group boundaries through marriage exchange. Characterising the rules of endogamy that regulate intermarriage between Focus Group and Neighbour Group helps us the relationship between the two groups in terms of community identity. If marriage between individuals from the two groups is encouraged or prescribed as a means of reinforcing and perpetrating group identity, this likely means that, independently of the languages they speak, the two groups conceive of themselves as one (e.g. one descent group, one social group, one ethnicity, one area etc). In other words,
