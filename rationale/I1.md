## I1: What language do Neighbour Group people typically speak when interacting with Focus Group people in domain X?

- The Focus Group language

- The Neighbour Group language

- Some other language

- This is highly contextual



**Goal**

This question is asking about the input a Focus Group person receives from Neighbour Group people in a given social domain. It is also an indirect measure of asymmetries characterising the contact situation. For instance, if, on average, Neighbour Group people are likely to use the Focus Group language in interactions with Focus Group people, this can be an indication of contextual and/or more fundamental asymmetries in the social dynamics between the two groups within the contact situation at stake.



**Definitions**

- *The Focus Group language/The Neighbour Group language/Some other language*: So-called monolingual modes of interaction. These options are mutually exclusive, that is, if more than one language is used in interaction, please select the fourth option, "This is highly contextual‚Äù.
- *This is highly contextual*: encompasses interaction in which more than one language is used, including but not limited to phenomena that come under the umbrella terms "code-switching" and/or "code-mixing".
