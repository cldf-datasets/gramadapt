## I1: What language do Neighbour Group people typically speak when interacting with Focus Group people in domain X?

- The Focus Group language
- The Neighbour Group language
- Some other language
- This is highly contextual


**Goal**

This question is asking about the input a Focus Group person receives from Neighbour Group people in a given social domain. We may surmise that if a Focus Group are exposed to the Neighbour Group language through this domain, they will have opportunities to comprehend or produce the Neighbour language.

It is also an indirect measure of asymmetries characterising the contact situation. For instance, if, on average, Neighbour Group people are likely to use the Focus Group language in interactions with Focus Group people, this can be an indication of contextual and/or more fundamental asymmetries in the social dynamics between the two groups within the contact situation at stake.


**Definitions**

- *The Focus Group language/The Neighbour Group language/Some other language*: So-called monolingual modes of interaction. These options are mutually exclusive, that is, if more than one language is used in interaction, please select the fourth option, "This is highly contextual‚Äù.
- *This is highly contextual*: encompasses interaction in which more than one language is used, including but not limited to phenomena that come under the umbrella terms "code-switching" and/or "code-mixing".


**Theoretical support**

The amount and type of linguistic input an individual receives has a direct consequence on an individual's linguistic output. Points of contention regarding input include how the input is processed into acquisition (see Barcroft and Wong 2012 in the context of second language acquisition), and what constitutes an adequate threshold for input to lead to acquisition; that, the role of frequency.

There is much discussion around kinds of frequency (e.g. type vs token, relative vs absolute) and how these frequencies affect different kinds of linguistic structures, (see Lieven 2010). The interaction of frequency with other factors such as salience and communicative intent are also a complicating factor in understanding the role of frequency. What remains consistent throughout the fine-grained discussion, however, is the consensus that frequency plays a role in how humans build models of linguistic systems. Frequency is relevant in both first and second language acquisitions (see Ambridge et al 2015 for the former, Gass 2018 for the latter), learning sociolinguistic variation (see Ellis 2002: 170-3), and grammaticalisation (Bybee and Hopper 2001, Bybee 2003).

Input and frequency are both related to humans' ability for statistical learning.
Evidence suggests that statistical learning models can account for language acquisition from infants through to adults (see Erickson & Thiessen2015). Different models of statistical learning will emphasise different learning mechanisms, but all acknowledge the roles of linguistic input, frequency, variability, distribution, and co-occurrence probabilities.
