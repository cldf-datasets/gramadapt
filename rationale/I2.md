**Goal**

This question is trying to get a sense of how much a Focus Group person would comprehend the linguistic input they are receiving. For example, in situations of receptive multilingualism, we may expect the Focus Group person understands the Neighbour Groupâ€™s language without necessarily actively using it in a given interactional context.

The scale is as follows:

- *Very well:* Focus Group people have high comprehension skills of Neighbour Group language & understand the contextual situation very well
- *Well*: Focus Group people have low comprehension skills of Neighbour Group language but understand the contextual situation very well.
