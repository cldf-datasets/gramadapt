## D1: Polyandry - Exchange & Marriage (DEM29)

Is polyandry possible for Focus Group women?andry
Is poly possible for Neighbour Group women?

If possible, is polyandry of fraternal type?If possible, is polyandry of fraternal type?

If possible, is polyandry of non-fraternal type?If possible, is polyandry of non-fraternal type?



**Goal**

This question identifies whether polyandry occurs in Focus Group society or in Neighbour Group society. The answers to this question should be about the overall pattern in society, and not restricted to marriages between Focus Group and Neighbour Group people.



The answers to this question may help us further understand the nature of population movements between the two groups, and the general complexity of marriage dynamics.



**Definitions**

*Polyandry*, the marriage exchange pattern whereby women take more than one spouse, is the rarest form of polygamy worldwide. It is particularly common in the Himalayan regions of South Asia, but also attested in Africa, Oceania, and Native America.

- *Fraternal polyandry*: one woman is married to a group of brothers.
- *Non-fraternal polyandry:* a woman’s sexual partners and spouses are not related by kin.




**Examples**

- *Fraternal polyandry*is common in the mountainous areas of Nepal and Tibet (Berreman 1962; 1978; Goldstein 1971; 1976) as among the Nyinba, where brothers live together with their shared spouse and children (Levine 1988). Each child is recognised by one of the potential fathers, even when paternity is biologically unclear. This type of polygamous system has been explained as the result of demographic imbalance between men and women, due to women’s lower survival rates. It also has fundamental repercussions at the socio-economic level, in that it guarantees preservation of the joint estate, which is patrilineally transmitted. (Berreman 1978; 1980; Willett 1997.)
- *Non-fraternal polyandry*: The Nayar are an upper caste group of Eastern India organised in small kingdoms with matrilineal descent and non-fraternal polyandry. Traditionally, no institutionalised type of marriage exchange existed in the community. When reaching puberty age, women could start entertaining sexual partnership with several men (usually up to eight), and would later be responsible for raising their children within the matrilineal household, where the only cohabiting adult males would be other members of the matrilineage (e.g. their brothers). Two ritual acts defined women’s polyandry as legitimate: the *tali*tying, through which a woman in puberty age would become connected to a young man from an allied lineage with the sole obligation of later mourning for his death together with her own children, and the midwife payment through which one of the lovers was expected to acknowledge the paternity of any of the children the woman would bear. (Gough 1952; 1959; 1965.)
