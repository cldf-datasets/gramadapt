## D12: How often are these speech styles typically used during practices of domain X, in comparison with unmonitored speech? 


- Always
- Sometimes
- As much as unmonitored speech
- Rarely
- Never

**Goal**

The goal is this question is to discern whether special speech styles identified in D9 form a large part of speakers linguistic output. 

**Definitions**

For the purposes of this questionnaire, we define _speech styles_ as socio-semantically informed ways of speaking (e.g. Bell 1984; Coupland 2007: 2) in contrast to unmonitored and so-called _vernacular ways of speaking_.

Strictly speaking, unmonitored and vernacular ways of speaking could be argued as style unto themselves. The reason for our operational definition of _speech style_ is two-fold. We have chosen a binary “monitored vs unmonitored” distinction as an axis of interest due to findings from Labovian sociolinguistics concerning the two modes (see Theoretical & Empirical Support below). Secondly, choosing a binary distinction makes operationalising the question easier, as we cannot _a priori_ know or decide what specific speech styles are important in language change phenomena across time and place. As the examples below demonstrate, we can identify a variety of speech style types, all of which have particular uses and nuances depending on the subfield of research, the social domain under investigation, and geographic region of a community.

The term _vernacular_ in Labovian sociolinguistics is a natural speech style, in opposition to monitored or standardised speech styles (Labov 1972, cf. Coupland 2009). Coupland (2016: 410) summarises the notion of Labovian vernaculars as formally systematic, represent speaking in its most natural and least monitored conditions, and are viewed as the most consequential way of speaking for the study of language change.

**Example**

Examples of speech styles under the operational definition include:

- formal registers
- academic and legalese jargons
- the high variety in diglossic situations
- lects associated with ceremonial events
- kinship registers
- standard varieties (e.g. national standards)
- trade jargons
-
