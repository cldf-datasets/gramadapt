**Goal**

The goal of this question is to identify whether the family and co-residential unit are the same for the majority of the time over the course of a marriage. All societies appear to have different residential arrangements depending on the life stage of an individual (what in anthropological parlance is called *the development cycle*). We are interested in the degree of overlap between family and co-residential unit insofar as it has some kind of impact on language use and learning.



**Examples**

- YES for *mothers (and their children) who live with their husbands as part of a co-residential unit*: Described as “nuclear family” or “conjugal unit”, e.g. nomad tents in parts of Kham, Tibet (Thargyal 2007).
- YES for *mothers(and their children) live with their mothers:* Where both the husband and wife continue to reside with their families of origin even after marriage. Children usually reside with the mother. Described as natalocal residence in anthropological parlance, e.g. the Nayar of western Senegal (Gough 1959), or the Akan of Ghana/Ivory Coast.
- YES for *mothers (and their children) live with their mother-in-laws:* Extended kin or other adults may also be living with the mother, husband, and children, such as Dayak long houses in Malaysia (Harrison 1976; Helliwell 1992), and the Balkan *zadruga*. Families residing in separated private dwelling within a larger co-residential units fall in this category, e.g. Huave house-lots (ndén) in Mexico (Diebold 1966).


**Theoretical & Empirical Support**

Knowing whether a woman, her child, and the father of the child are cohabiting is important for two reasons. 1) Because we want to get a sense of how much opportunity a Focus Group person has to learn and use the Neighbour Group language from their Neighbour Group spouse, and 2) we want to get a sense of how much opportunity a Focus Group child has to learn and use the Neighbour Group language from their Neighbour Group parent. 

Anthropological works show very clearly that a family is not necessarily the same as a daily co-residential unit. Research on child bilingual acquisition in interlingual households have found that the amount of input of a language heavily affects the likelihood of successful language transmission; especially if one of the parental languages is a minority language (Yamamoto 2001, de Houwer 2007). Given this, we would want to know whether families do indeed spend much of their daily life together or not. If a family and co-residential unit do not overlap, we may surmise that there is less language learning and socialisation opportunities compared to a group where family and co-residential units do indeed overlap.

The answer to this question is treated as one of a number of factors that play a role in affecting the outcomes of language change. The factor by itself is likely unable to affect outcomes, but in combination with other factors, is thought to play a role.

  abstract = {This article reports on a study that addresses the following question: why do some children exposed to two languages from early on fail to speak those two languages? Questionnaire data were collected in 1,899 families in which at least one of the parents spoke a language other than the majority language. Each questionnaire asked about the home language use of a family consisting of at least one parent and one child between the ages of 6 and 10 years old. The results show that the children in these families all spoke the majority language, but that minority language use was not universal. Differences in parental language input patterns used at home correlated with differences in child minority language use. Home input patterns where both parents used the minority language and where at most one parent spoke the majority language had a high chance of success. The ``one parent--one language'' strategy did not provide a necessary nor sufficient input condition. Implications for bilingual families are discussed.},
