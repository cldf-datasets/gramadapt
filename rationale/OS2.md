## OS2: How many levels of jurisdictional hierarchy are there in the Neighbour Group, beyond the local community?


- No levels
- One level 
- Two levels 
- Three levels 
- Four levels

**Goal**

The purpose of this question is to get a loose characterisation of the political complexity of the Neighbour Group society.



**Definitions**

- The term *jurisdictional hierarchy* refers to a rank with jurisdictional authority, such as the ability to punish transgressors.
- The term *local community* refers to the closest social circle to the household environment, but outside the realm of family and kin, who typically reside together in face-to-face association.




This question and possible answers are adapted from question EA003 in the Ethnographic Atlas (Murdock et al. 1999) that is available in D-Place (Kirby et al. 2016; 2018b; see [https://d-place.org/parameters/EA033#1/30/153](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fd-place.org%2Fparameters%2FEA033%231%2F30%2F153&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0ACmFJj4UELCwTIyzkS-lV))



- *No levels:* no political authority beyond community

- *One level:* for example, described as petty chiefdoms.

- *Two levels:* for example, described as large chiefdoms. Often has some centralised structures.

- *Three levels:* for example, described as states. Often has some centralised structures.

- *Four levels:* for example, described as large states. Often has some centralised structures.



The examples in parenthesis are from Giuliano & Nunn (2018). This variable attempts to characterises the vertical political structure within a society at a level larger than the local community. We take the same definition of local community we use in the domains questionnaire: closest to the household environment, but outside the realm of family and kin, and who typically reside together in face-to-face association.” (borrowed partially from Murdock et al. 1945)



Note that this variable is not concerned with the relationships between distinct societies, nor does it track the political structure within the local community.



As Skirgård (2021) notes, it appears that a “society” corresponds to a “language community”, so for the purposes of this questionnaire we will take the response to this question as loosely representative of the Focus Group as a whole.



**Theoretical Support**

Political complexity is widely used in studies of cultural evolution (Giuliano & Nunn 2018). Currie & Mace (2009) found political complexity and type of subsistence strategy to be the best predictors to explain the geographic distribution of languages, and conclude that “more complex societies” may be favoured in process of cultural group selection.



The motivation behind the interest in political complexity is based on observations that human history has seen the absorption of less complex societies by more complex ones (e.g. as stated in World Systems Theory, XXX). Given this, we may surmise that when language contact occurs between societies/language communities of differing complexities, we are more likely to see phenomena that resembles language shift.



Note it has also been noted that these scales of political complexity may also in fact be proxies for social network cohesion (Skirgård 2021: 53; c.f. Grace 1992).
