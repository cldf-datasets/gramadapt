NoNo

The aim of this question is to identify whether there are any formally recognised hierarchical relationships particular to the organisation of work in the contact situation at stake



**Definitions**

**Examples**

**Theoretical and Empirical Support**

The rationale for this question is grounded in the understanding that different communities of practice, and especially those associated with differences in power, can results in speech styles and practices that are unique to those contexts.



Being in positions of authority at work may lead to differential speech styles when compared to people in non-authorative positions. A study of Tokyo Japanese natural speech found that being in positions of authority had consequences for the kinds of linguistic constructions favoured in production. Both men and women in positions of authority at work favored full-forms of predicates, in contrast to home-maker women who preferred fragmental and elided utterances (Takano 2000; 2001). The analysis presented is that this is difference is due to the relatively wider and heterogeneous communication networks of the workers in leadership positions, who are required to speak directly. The uses of utterance-final forms by working women and men in non-authoritative positions were found to be somewhere in between workers in positions of authority, and the homemakers.
