## E4: What type of data informed your answers to the questions in domain X, overall?



**Goal**

Through this question we seek information about what forms the basis of respondentsâ€™ answers. We recognise that many of the questions posed in this questionnaire are outside the considerations of most researchers, and that respondents may have consulted various sources in order to respond. This question is an opportunity for respondents to indicate the sources that were consulted.
