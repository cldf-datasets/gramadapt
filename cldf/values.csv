set29-DEM00,set29-F,DEM00,Yes,DEM00-yes,"Both social exchange and marriage are relevant to contact between various subgroups of the Burarra and Yolngu Matha language groups. These connections were likely more codified in pre-colonial and early colonial times, but certainly continue in the present time. Both ceremony and gift-exchange are salient domains. I provide specific examples below.
EXCHANGE BETWEEN SPECIFIC GROUPS
Distinct patterns of exchange and marriage exist between different clan and dialect groups within the Burarra and Yolngu Matha groups. Extensive ceremonial, cultural and economic links existed and still exist to a degree between the Yan-nhangu (a Yolngu group of the Crocodile Islands) and north-eastern Burarra people who own territory around Cape Stewart (e.g. Bowern and James 2006). The two groups interact closely and regularly, characterising themselves as ‘close’ (yi-gurrepa in Burarra; galki in Yan-nhangu) (Bagshaw 1998: 249). The two groups share major religious resources and can be subsumed under a variety of (in some cases moiety-specific) designations which each pick out some salient aspect of the shared territory (e.g. Maringa (‘coast’); Gulala (‘mangrove pod’)).
At the southern reaches of Burarra territory, speakers of the Gun-nartpa dialect of Burarra also connect closely with Yolngu groups. They are more closely affiliated with inland freshwater country kin from the Yolngu Djinang/Wurlaki-speaking clans (as well as Rembarrnga/Kune, Kuninjku and Gurr-goni – speaking clans) than with their coastal Burarra neighbours. They connect also with Yolngu groups from the further-afield Yurrwi/Milingimbi area on the Crocodile Islands (including Yan-nhangu speaking groups). There is a local theory of language origins that states that the Gun-nartpa, along with other Burarra speakers, originated at Yurrwi, but following tribal war the ancestors of the Gun-nartpa moved inland. A contemporary example of the connection between these groups is the presence of large jambang ‘tamarind’ trees that grow at Gochan Jiny-jirra, a Gun-nartpa outstation of the An-nguliny clan. These were grown from seeds collected from Yurrwi by a young Gun-nartpa man who was encouraged to take them from a Macassan trepang site by the local landowners. As Carew notes, “the presence of the trees is an instantiation of the kinship and ceremonial connections between their group and Yirrichinga clan groups at Milingimbi, who do own Macassan sites” (Carew 2016: 72).
At various points along the Burarra/Yolngu boundary, speakers from both groups have been in close long-term contact within particular clan ‘aggregates’ or ‘clusters’ – higher level groupings of clans which were/are affiliated, which would have spent much time together (perhaps seasonally) and which may share Dreamings, sites and territory. Examples: the Manydjikay clan aggregate includes Burarra and Yan-nhangu (Keen 1978: 24; see also Bagshaw 1998: 271), and the Marrangu clan aggregate or ceremonial polity includes (Jowunga/Dhuwa moiety) Djinang and Martay Burarra clans (Elliot 1991, 2015; Carew 2016).

THE NATURE OF BURARRA/YOLNGU CEREMONIAL EXCHANGE 
– ceremony
Exchange between Burarra and Yolngu groups occurs often through diplomacy rituals, funeral performances and initiation ceremonies. The reciprocity observable in ceremonial participation and exchange is central to structuring social life in Arnhem Land (Carew 2016: 102, Brown 2014). Examples of ceremonies conducted for inter-group diplomacy which implicate these two groups include Rom (involving the presentation of a decorated pole as a gift e.g. Altman 2008, Wild 1986) and Marrajiri (pre-colonially a post-burial ceremony but now a birth celebration, e.g. Borsboom 1978). Historically, these ceremonies would have provided opportunities for exchanging goods, but now goods are acquired through the market. Nevertheless, ceremonies like these continue to provide opportunities for social exchange and serve as markers of distinct group identity (Altman 2008: 15).
– funerals and initiation
Funerals, especially for clan leaders, and japi (young men’s initiation), and associated bunggul (dance performance) and manakay (song performance), are other rituals attracting participants from across a large region (e.g. Brown 2014) and regularly across Burarra/Yolngu Matha groups. Typically particular kin relations will have special roles in these ceremonies, necessitating cooperation and exchange between culturally connected groups, such as the Burarra and Yolngu. Mortuary rituals also function as sites of ceremonial exchange, such as the lorrkon ceremony performed by both Yolngu (e.g. Djinang) and Burarra groups (e.g. Keen 1978: 157) in which the bones of dead person are prepared for final internment in a carved and painted hollow log. The film ‘Waiting for Harry’ (McKenzie 1980) documents the recovery of the remains of Frank Gurrmanamana's brother (who had been buried in Maningrida six years earlier) to Jina-wunya – a Burarra outstation – for Frank for arrange the final mortuary ceremony. The ceremony crucially involved the participation of Yan-nhangu men from Cape Stewart whose mothers’ mothers came from the deceased’s clan (see also Clunies-Ross 1989). At this and other similar funeral/mortuary gatherings involving Burarra and Yolngu groups, there is evidence from several accounts that Burarra has been used as a lingua franca between the coastal groups (Carew 2016: 79). E.g. Clunies-Ross (1983) describes a Yan-nhangu man giving an oration in Burarra at an An-barra Burarra funeral, his language being “somewhat accented but not ... ungrammatical” (Clunies-Ross 1983:10) (although Carew (2016: 79) suggests that this may in fact just be the Maringa dialect of Burarra).

– gift exchange

Gift exchange between the Burarra and Yolngu has occurred as a ritualised part of ceremonial exchange, and also in some other non-ritualised contexts. As part of the modern Marajiri/Maradjiri ceremony, for example, a ‘birth pole’ is prepared and gifted ""to make friends"" with another group, ""[to] stress the indissoluble unity between a group of people, natural species and a certain locality"" (Borsboom 1978: xiv and 15, cited in Elliot 1991). The gifting described above of tamarind seeds to a young Gun-nartpa man from landowners at Yurrwi provides an example of non-ceremonial gifting (Carew 2016: 72).

N.B.: REGARDING DESCRIBING CONTACT BETWEEN THESE GROUPS
1) A complicating factor in discussing contact between language groups in northern Australia is that language does not always delineate the most salient and important social boundaries between groups. That is to say, examples are readily observable where a single social and political group (such as a clan) is affiliated with more than one language (e.g. the Gamal and Bindararr clans which are affiliated with both Burarra and the Yolngu variety Yan-nhangu). Conversely, there are groups which are socially, culturally and geographically distinct but which ostensibly share the same language (e.g. the ‘freshwater’ Gun-nartpa people and the coastal Burarra, both of whom speak Burarra). As anthropologist Ad Borsboom notes of Djinang-speaking groups: “[s]hared language does not make a unity of these clans” (Borsboom 1978:23, see also Keen 1978; Carew 2016). Instead, the clan is typically the most prominent social unit, with language one of many secondary indices for identity in the region. ‘Burarra’ and ‘Yolngu Matha’, then, refer to loose affiliations of interconnected social groups, but are cross-cut by various other intergroup boundaries – social, ceremonial, cultural, economic, geographical etc. It’s therefore the case that I am able to generalise across these loose groups on some points but on others I will need to be more specific, say at the clan/clan aggregate/dialect or someother level (where information exists).
2) When considering contact between these two groups, it’s important to centralise the long-standing high levels of multilingualism in the region. Although an individual will typically identify with a single language through her/his patrilineal line, local language repertoires usually take in several languages. So many Burarra people would have spoken Yolngu languages pre-colonially and still do, and vice versa. So yes there is ‘contact’ between somewhat distinct social groups which can be identified as Burarra or Yolngu, but linguistic contact is not restricted to these encounters as many speakers involved would already speak both languages since childhood (e.g. through mother or grandparents, see marriage discussion below). For example, Gun-nartpa people today typically speak the Yolngu language Djinang and Kune as well their own variety of Burarra (Carew 2016: 67).",,set29,Jill Vaughan

Strong language ideologies exist dictating use of the patrilect by both groups across all settings, and this does play out in many contexts, including certain more 'performative' and broadcast communication, and in the practice of receptive multilingualism whereby e.g. married couples will each use their own language in conversation. 

However situations also arise where Burarra and YM speakers would use an L2, and for these speakers that would often be Burarra and YM. E.g. during ceremonial exchange ppl may use the language of their hosts. Clunies-Ross (1983: 10) notes that Burarra is used in an funeral oration by a Yan-nhangu man, and Elwell (1977: 25-6) also notes Gupapuyngu (YM) as a regional lingua franca among the 'eastern bloc'.

Code-switching does occur but is less prevalent than might be predicted from the typological congruence on the languages (Vaughan 2021) – i.e. Burarra and YM linguistically ‘congruent’ but not socially congruent (following Sebba 1998). Examples of intersentential code-switching are however fairly common, and intrasentential code-switching does happen sometimes, for example between Burarra and Yan-nhangu formerly as an expression of a hybrid ‘Yan-nhangu-Burarra’ identity which, in contemporary times, is now largely expressed through the Burarra language (as very few speakers now have fluent command of Yan-nhangu).",,set29,Jill Vaughan

From 1550 onwards such contacts with Italy increased, and ties with the UK began in 1800 but became strong from about 1850 and are strongest today. However, statistics and testimonies for the Sicilian period are scarce, with the result that most of my responses to the questionnaire concern the present time period (roughly the last decades) when contact with Sicily is still ongoing, albeit in a much wider international framework. As regards language, contact with Sicilian died out with the coming of the Knights of St John who introduced Italian, both as an official and a spoken language for the educated classes.

E.g. Elwell (1977: 24-26) groups the Burarra with various Yolngu groups (Djinang, Yan-ngangu, Gupapuyngu, Gumatj and Wangurri) under the 'Eastern Arnhem Land tribes' umbrella, noting their shared patrilineal social structure (also Armstrong 1967: 14-15).

Within a ceremonial context (as described above in discussion on influence), the relationship could be characterised as complementary and fairly egalitarian. And as is typical of small-scale multilingual contexts, the languages are understood to be egalitarian, with each having its own special rights associated with a particular tract of land. Having said this, in Clunies-Ross' (1989: 120) discussion of the participation of Yan-nhangu (YM) men in a Burarra mortuary ritual says the following: ""It is clear from this speech [i.e. a speech from one of the Yan-nhangu men] and many others like it on the Waiting for Harry footage that the spirit of cooperation and helpfulness between aburramari [i.e. men whose mother's mothers came from the deceased's clan] and the owning clans points to an only thinly veiled underlying rivalry. Rivalry between owners and ngamonbeninga [i.e. men whose mother's came from the deceased's clan] is also evident, and in both cases alternates with statements of concern and threat against anyone who would dare to steal and use their clan designs without permission"".",,set29,Jill Vaughan

I would expect that the patrilect would be observed in many contexts (incl, receptive multilingual conversations) but that concessions to the landowners languages would be made in other settings. It has also been noted that Burarra functioned as a lingua franca of sorts in mixed contexts, so the balance may tip slightly in this direction in some settings. E.g. as described above a Yan-nhangu man is noted to have delivered a funeral address in Burarra. Also in early footage of Maningrida, government officials are explaining voting to a large group of local people from several language groups. A senior local man is engaged to translate and deliver the information in broadcast speech to the group and Burarra is the language used (the man is Burarra though).",,set29,Jill Vaughan

Men whose mothers were from the deceased's clan are responsible for actually drawing the designs, as the custodians of the owner's sacred emblems through their mothers' affiliation. Finally, the visiting men whose mother's mothers were from the deceased's clan (Yan-nhangu men) have the special role of inspecting the work at the end of the preparation phase and approving it so the final phase of breaking up the deceased's bones and placing them in the hollow log can commence.

set29-DEM26_DEME26-1,set29-F,DEM26_DEME26-1,B,DEM26_DEME26-1-B,"Marriage rules dictate ideal marriage with designated skin (‘malk’) groups – subsections of the opposite moiety. This also means outside the clan group, since clans are patrilineal and therefore made up of people from the same moiety. Both groups have ideologies about which kin category is an ideal marriage. For Yolngu – “the ideal wife for a man is a woman classified as 'mother's brother's daughter', called galay (Warner 1969:43). An actual MBD is best, but if no-one of that near relationship is available, then one as near by blood as possible is preferred (1969:46); ""men marry a woman of their mother's clan who is their galay, and/or the daughter of a mukul rumaru of their mother's mother's clan or a classificatory mother's mother's clan"" (Keen 1978:110). For Burarra – “a man has rights in certain women as potential mothers-in-law. These are women to whom the man applies the kin term djabur, who are members of his mother's generation or alternate generations, and who are members of his mother's mother's patrilineal group, or whose own mother's mothers belong(ed) to the man's patrilineal group. Among a man's genealogically closest djabur, his MMBD, MMBSSD, FZDD and DDD are his potential mothers-in-law” (Keen 1982). These are all kin categories of the opposite moiety, and often result in close connections between clans linked by regular marriage links. As Keen (1982) summarises: “The Gidjingali [Burarra] community consists of a number of small patrilineal land-owning units linked together in a dense mesh of marriage ties through which each group is united to many of the others. The Yolngu clan on the other hand is linked to far fewer groups, but by many marriage ties to each group. Members of two clans of the opposite moiety who are united by a persistent marriage alliance are political allies. Clans of the same moiety in a wife-bestower-wife- receiver relation (a relation of MM-ZDC, mdri-gutharra in the idiom of kinship) are often members of the same named clan-aggregate and are also political allies in some contexts”. Keen (1982, 2016) also notes how these webs of cross-cutting marriages between patrigroups map onto regional (often referred to as dialect) identities.

There are some sources that state a (Yolngu) ideology about marrying within the clan, such as this one from a senior Yolngu man: ""Marrying from another tribal clan is dishonouring to the clan group and will “mix” the descendant line. The purpose of both men and women under Ngarra marriage law is to continue the descendant line of the tribal clan […] A boyfriend or girlfriend from another clan is known as a “lubra” boyfriend or girlfriend. Having a lubra boyfriend or girlfriend is inappropriate and dangerous as it is a breach of Ngarra marriage law and a breach of kinship rules and offenders may be cursed. A lubra boyfriend or girlfriend may be seen as a prostitute."" (Gaymarani 2011: 290). However since clans are patrilineal this would mean marrying within the moiety which contravenes the marriage-outside-the-moiety ideology. Perhaps here ‘clan’ refers in fact to some higher level grouping or a different clan understood to provide marriage partners? In any case clan exogamy certainly is the norm in practice.

Regarding language group – for Burarra and Yolngu people, these are sometimes outside of linguistic group, but is not stated as an ideology. These are relatively large language groups, so this happens a bit less often than for some smaller language groups, but is still common enough. In the same Yolngu source as above though, Gaymarani states “A mixed marriage (Yolngu with non-Yolngu) will only cause one problem after another and there will be no sense of peace in the marriage” so perhaps these ideologies do exist at least on one side? Of Keen’s (1982) account, McConvell (2013) says, “Keen, in keeping with the practice of most anthropologists (‘fictive closure’ In Denham’s terms) talks about Yolngu marriage (i.e. between Yolngu) and does not mention the fact that there are significant numbers of marriages between Yolngu and neighbouring groups, including the Burarra.”",,set29,Jill Vaughan

This also means outside the clan group, since clans are patrilineal and therefore made up of people from the same moiety. Both groups have ideologies about which kin category is an ideal marriage. For Yolngu – “the ideal wife for a man is a woman classified as 'mother's brother's daughter', called galay (Warner 1969:43). An actual MBD is best, but if no-one of that near relationship is available, then one as near by blood as possible is preferred (1969:46); ""men marry a woman of their mother's clan who is their galay, and/or the daughter of a mukul rumaru of their mother's mother's clan or a classificatory mother's mother's clan"" (Keen 1978:110). For Burarra – “a man has rights in certain women as potential mothers-in-law. These are women to whom the man applies the kin term djabur, who are members of his mother's generation or alternate generations, and who are members of his mother's mother's patrilineal group, or whose own mother's mothers belong(ed) to the man's patrilineal group. Among a man's genealogically closest djabur, his MMBD, MMBSSD, FZDD and DDD are his potential mothers-in-law” (Keen 1982). These are all kin categories of the opposite moiety, and often result in close connections between clans linked by regular marriage links. As Keen (1982) summarises: “The Gidjingali [Burarra] community consists of a number of small patrilineal land-owning units linked together in a dense mesh of marriage ties through which each group is united to many of the others. The Yolngu clan on the other hand is linked to far fewer groups, but by many marriage ties to each group. Members of two clans of the opposite moiety who are united by a persistent marriage alliance are political allies. Clans of the same moiety in a wife-bestower-wife- receiver relation (a relation of MM-ZDC, mdri-gutharra in the idiom of kinship) are often members of the same named clan-aggregate and are also political allies in some contexts”. Keen (1982, 2016) also notes how these webs of cross-cutting marriages between patrigroups map onto regional (often referred to as dialect) identities.

There are some sources that state a (Yolngu) ideology about marrying within the clan, such as this one from a senior Yolngu man: ""Marrying from another tribal clan is dishonouring to the clan group and will “mix” the descendant line. The purpose of both men and women under Ngarra marriage law is to continue the descendant line of the tribal clan […] A boyfriend or girlfriend from another clan is known as a “lubra” boyfriend or girlfriend. Having a lubra boyfriend or girlfriend is inappropriate and dangerous as it is a breach of Ngarra marriage law and a breach of kinship rules and offenders may be cursed. A lubra boyfriend or girlfriend may be seen as a prostitute."" (Gaymarani 2011: 290). However since clans are patrilineal this would mean marrying within the moiety which contravenes the marriage-outside-the-moiety ideology. Perhaps here ‘clan’ refers in fact to some higher level grouping or a different clan understood to provide marriage partners? In any case clan exogamy certainly is the norm in practice.

Regarding language group – for Burarra and Yolngu people, these are sometimes outside of linguistic group, but is not stated as an ideology. These are relatively large language groups, so this happens a bit less often than for some smaller language groups, but is still common enough. In the same Yolngu source as above though, Gaymarani states “A mixed marriage (Yolngu with non-Yolngu) will only cause one problem after another and there will be no sense of peace in the marriage” so perhaps these ideologies do exist at least on one side? Of Keen’s (1982) account, McConvell (2013) says, “Keen, in keeping with the practice of most anthropologists (‘fictive closure’ In Denham’s terms) talks about Yolngu marriage (i.e. between Yolngu) and does not mention the fact that there are significant numbers of marriages between Yolngu and neighbouring groups, including the Burarra.”",,set29,Jill Vaughan

In the same Yolngu source as above though, Gaymarani states “A mixed marriage (Yolngu with non-Yolngu) will only cause one problem after another and there will be no sense of peace in the marriage” so perhaps these ideologies do exist at least on one side? Of Keen’s (1982) account, McConvell (2013) says, “Keen, in keeping with the practice of most anthropologists (‘fictive closure’ In Denham’s terms) talks about Yolngu marriage (i.e. between Yolngu) and does not mention the fact that there are significant numbers of marriages between Yolngu and neighbouring groups, including the Burarra.”",,set29,Jill Vaughan

This is for a variety of reasons summarised below (all from Keen 1982):
– Yolngu men especially continue to marry new wives across the lifespan, and an ‘appropriate’ age difference is more likely to be consistently reproduced in the Yolngu system
– Burarra men are less likely than Yolngu men to find women in whom they have primary rights as potential wives of marriageable age
– married Burarra men are expected to be generous in waiving their rights in women for the benefit of unmarried men. Yolngu men are not so much – older brothers are likely to marry most ‘claimable’ women
– the smaller Burarra patrilineal groups are not as effective as political units, providing little or no support for male members' claims in women, while larger Yolngu clans are able to provide effective support for members' claims

When a woman died before bearing multiple children the family of the wife would provide another woman (e.g. a sister of the deceased) to marry the widower or repay the bride price. These customs led to sequential marriages, not simultaneous marriages. Extramarital relationships were not considered acceptable, and compensation to a woman's family was owed depending on the circumstances of the extramarital relationship. Kroeber (1925, 32) provides an account of a Karuk woman whose grandfather had wives in five different locations, including among Yurok, Hupa, and Shasta settlements through half-marriage (a marriage arrangement where the wife and her children remained with the wife's family). Kroeber speculates that this resulted from a wealthy man using partial bride prices to legitimize relationships and offspring after his romantic partners became pregnant, rather than a customary form of pre-arranged marriage. There is no indication that this sort of polygyny was customary or common among Yurok or Karuk speakers.",,set32,Hannah Haynie

set29-DEM28_DEME28-3,set29-F,DEM28_DEME28-3,Yes,DEM28_DEME28-3-yes,"Keen (1982) ‘How Some Murngin Men Marry Ten Wives: The Marital Implications of Matrilateral Cross-Cousin Structures’ summarises this issue thoroughly. While polygyny is possible for Burarra men, with the average number of wives per (married) man 1.52, Yolngu men tend to marry more wives with an average of 2.21 per (married) man and with some older Yolngu men with as many as ten wives by the time they are in their 50s and 60s.

This is for a variety of reasons summarised below (all from Keen 1982):
– Yolngu men especially continue to marry new wives across the lifespan, and an ‘appropriate’ age difference is more likely to be consistently reproduced in the Yolngu system
– Burarra men are less likely than Yolngu men to find women in whom they have primary rights as potential wives of marriageable age
– married Burarra men are expected to be generous in waiving their rights in women for the benefit of unmarried men. Yolngu men are not so much – older brothers are likely to marry most ‘claimable’ women
– the smaller Burarra patrilineal groups are not as effective as political units, providing little or no support for male members' claims in women, while larger Yolngu clans are able to provide effective support for members' claims

Therefore the men with the most wives are likely to be Yolngu eldest brothers who are members of relatively large clans.",,set29,Jill Vaughan

On the other hand, marriages involved a significant economic transaction and bride price was a significant factor in a family's social status, which may have created incentives other than personal enjoyment for some marriages. Because marriage exchanges between Yurok and Karuk people were neither required through exogamy, nor discouraged for social reasons, nor driven by specific subsistence needs or power imbalances, it is likely that these marriages were largely driven by the desire of individuals to spend time with one another and were thus somewhat friendly.",,set32,Hannah Haynie

This sample may not be entirely representative, but it is unlikely that the actual proportion of Yurok families in contact with Karuk through marriage is more than double this percentage. Exogamous marriage in general seems to make up a relatively small proportion of Yurok marriages (56 of 413 in Waterman and Kroeber's sample, or about 14%), likely due to the impact of geographic proximity on marital choices. Waterman and Kroeber report that a majority of the marriages involving Yurok men and non-Yurok women are full marriages in which the bride relocated to the groom's community, while almost half of the marriages between Yurok women and non-Yurok men were ""half marriages"" in which the women remained living with their families.

set05-DEM96,set05-F,DEM96,"Uruava, Torau and Mono speakers. Papapana ancestors were part of a migration from the south of Bougainville in the mid–19th century which settled first in the area around Kieta and Arawa (the once Uruava-speaking area), moved north up the eastern coast to the contemporary Papapana-speaking area, Teperoi, before moving south again, with a possible halt in Vito (contemporary Torau-speaking area), before settling in Teperoi in the late–19th century. Although Ross (1988) placed Papapana in the Nehan-North Bougainville subgroup of Northwest Solomonic (containing the languages of northern Bougainville and Buka), there are similarities in lexicon and syntax which raise the possibility that Papapana is related more closely to Uruava, and perhaps even Torau and Mono. This is further supported by i) similar Papuan-induced grammatical changes in these four languages (Evans and Palmer 2011, Smith 2016), ii) 3 of the 6 Papapana clan names are cognate with Uruavan clan names (Palmer 2007), iii) the name Papapana could come from Uruava pa-papa-na ‘uncles (mother’s brothers)’ (Palmer 2007).

Teop speakers. It seems that the history of the Papapana community is further complicated by intermarriage and further migrations from the north, including Teop speakers. This is supported by i) one of the Papapana clan names is cognate with a Teop clan name, ii) historical records by a missionary in the 1930s comment that the houses in Teperoi showed traces of two different tribes – from Buka&the north, and from Kieta (south), iii) a trader’s travelogue comments that the village’s reconstruction was reinforced by immigrants from north Bougainville and east Buka. 
Certainly in 2011-2013, there was intermarriage between Papapana speakers and Torau and Teop speakers (as well as other closely related languages like Halia and Tinputz).

There are similarities between Papapana and all the Northwest Solomonic languages above but it would be difficult to establish whether e.g. similar/identical lexemes result from genetic inheritance or contact.

Buin, Motuna/Siwai and Nasioi speakers. Speakers of these South Bougainville languages were recruited to work in the plantations surrounding Teperoi in the early 20th century. There are families in some of the Papapana villages like Maras and Kokoi, whose ancestors were Motuna or Buin speakers and who bought/were given Papapana land because they worked in the surrounding plantations. In 2011-2013 there were a number of intermarriages with Buin, Motuna/Siwai and Nasioi speakers, as well as Rotokas. This contact could have contributed, along with Rotokas, to the partial shift from left-headedness to right-headedness in Papapana (Smith 2016). There are also words in Papapana which are similar/identical to Rotokas but I don't know the direction of influence.",,,,set05,Ellen Smith-Dennis

No Kwoma woman would have agreed to marry into the Manambu language group since she lacked the canoeing skills of Manambu women. Likewise, Manambu women would never have agreed to marry Kwoma men since they intensely disliked, and were unskilled at, carrying heavy loads of produce in net bags slung from the backs of their heads along the steep and often slippery paths in the Washkuk Hills. Manambu women spend most of their days in tiny canoes that no Kwoma woman or man would ever step into.

Until very recently (e.g. 1980s) no marriages took place between Kwoma and Mamambu for ecological reasons. Today some do occur, but in all cases the couple leave their home communities to live in urban centres, since women are not adapted to live in their husband’s terrain. ",,set08,Ross Bowden

The connections between clans are mediated by kinship categories, and therefore also marriage patterns between groups. Cultural guidelines exist for which clans are preferred as marriage partners (e.g. in Keen’s (1978) data on Yolngu marriages the mother’s clan accounts for nearly three-quarters of pairings). Marriage patterns are therefore quite localised and may or may not cross language boundaries. 
The Burarra and the Yolngu have somewhat distinct marriage practices. For example, traditionally the Yolngu were known to have more wives, continuing to marry additional wives throughout the lifespan (Keen 1978: 7). Relevant groups which are known to intermarry include the Yan-nhangu with the Maringa/Martay Burarra and the Djinang with the Gun-nartpa Burarra (i.e. the same pairs which are strongly connected in ceremonial exchange as described above) (e.g. (Bagshaw 1998; Elwell 1977; Bowern and James 2006).",,set29,Jill Vaughan

 Young children are cared for by parents, especially mothers, mothers' sisters (who are considered mothers), grandmothers, other adults (most likely female), and older children. Researchers in northern Australia have noted the contemporary importance of the 'kid mob' – i.e. groups of children spending time together away from communal areas and from adult social activities – and this is assumed to have been the case pre-colonially also.

 Young children are cared for by parents, especially mothers, mothers' sisters (who are considered mothers), grandmothers, other adults (most likely female), and older children. Researchers in northern Australia have noted the contemporary importance of the 'kid mob' – i.e. groups of children spending time together away from communal areas and from adult social activities – and this is assumed to have been the case pre-colonially also. Loakes et al (2013): ""In Indigenous Australian communities, older children not only play with and interact with younger children, but are also expected to take on some responsibility with respect to looking after them in the community. This means that for many older children, a large proportion of their daily interactions are likely to take place with other children"". Hamilton (1981), in her study of Burarra child-rearing practices, notes that children usually stay with caregivers for the first 18–24 months of life, but from ~2 are expected to ""expected to adapt rapidly to new circumstances, to accept the peer group as the most significant force in its daily life, and to look to other children rather than mother or father for support and learning experiences"" (1981: 100). These peer groups then develop into the more structured 'kid mobs' for children 5-9. To an extent, these groups are determined by common language and kinship ties (1981: 103), and remain important for older kids and adolescents.",,set29,Jill Vaughan

From 1550 onwards such contacts with Italy increased, and ties with the UK began in 1800 but became strong from about 1850 and are strongest today. However, statistics and testimonies for the Sicilian period are scarce, with the result that most of my responses to the questionnaire concern the present time period (roughly the last decades) when contact with Sicily is still ongoing, albeit in a much wider international framework. As regards language, contact with Sicilian died out with the coming of the Knights of St John who introduced Italian, both as an official and a spoken language for the educated classes.

Apparently it was the norm for women to live with their husband's family in the focus period - this practice is no longer evident.

It is unclear whether these two ""half marriages"" overlap with the eight marriages between Yurok men and Karuk women counted by Waterman and Kroeber, but even if both of these ""half marriages"" involved Karuk women, a majority (75%) of Karuk wives in their survey would have relocated to Yurok areas. It should be noted that this source's focus on Yurok genealogies may result in an undercount of Yurok men who engaged in ""half marriage"" with Karuk women. There is no evidence to suggest that Karuk women were especially likely to enter into ""half marriage"" with Yurok men, however, and thus the best information suggests that relocation of Karuk wives to Yurok locations was common.",,set32,Hannah Haynie

A woman's first marriage was usually when they were teenagers but men often had to wait until they were 30, having proven themselves to the prospective wives' family and gone through all the male initiation ceremonies. So women often outlived their first husband and could end up having three or four over their lifetime. Men on the other hand could sometimes have multiple wives at the same time. [Responding focusing on the following social group/s:] The most intense social contact is perhaps between a young wife and her first husband's family so I focus here on the young wife in this context. She generally went to live with his family before her first period ceremony. The expectation was that if she did not already, she would learn to speak her husband's language.

There is a general notion among the Sibe people that the customs of both groups differ to the extent of making cohabitation difficult. However, Uighur women are considered beautiful by Sibe men and a certain number of intermarriages has been occuring all the time. Due to the scarcity of such cases it is difficult to make generalizations in this respect. I have personally known only two Sibe men with Uighur wives, and heard about some five more. Intermarriages with non-Sibe have been more frequent in enclaves of Sibe outside the main area of their habitation. However, the first thing our consultants always mentioned when asked about intermarriages with Uighur was that Sibe would rather mainly marry Mongols and Kazakhs (in addition to Chinese)  than Uighurs.

I cannot make assumptions about the past, although due to the spacial proximity some form of knowlege exchange most probably has taken place at some point. 
 The people of Djibonker are deeply integrated into Joola-speaking networks (Joola Kaasa, Joola Fogny, Joola Kujireray, Bayot) and marginally into Creole speaking networks. The overwelming majority is either Catholic, of local religion or both, whereas most speakers of Mandinka, or who identify as such are Muslim. The prohibition of alcohol in Islam is seen as a major obstacle to participation in cultural events by many Baïnounk Gubëeher and surrounding Joola, due to the fact that many rites involve the consumption of palmwine. Probably more detrimental to Baïnounk Gubëeher/Mandinka cultural integration is the widespread assumption that Mandinka language and culture dominates those who they 'colonize', leading to rapid language shift, name change and islamization. Often interviewees have accused other Baïnounk groups of being inauthentic due to Mandinka influence, and speaking 'impure' varieties of Baïnounk languages. This is of course anecdotal - citing emblematic but isolated items of vocabulary - and does not reflect real outcomes of language contact. More than anything it illustrates the perceived polluting capacity of Mandinka language and culture in the eyes of speakers of Baïnounk Gubëeher. It is ignored that Baïnounk Gubëeher also uses Mandinka loans and shows a heavy influence of local Joola varieties, which in turn is not considered as polluting or diluting real 'Bainounkness'.
 One participant as much as urged me to not quote Mandinka as one of the languages she speaks, because as she said, she has learned the language in her youth cohabiting with Mandinka, and understands it, but will never speak it again, because she wants nothing to do with Mandinka and hates everything to do with them. She also reported the common stereotype that Mandinka refuse to speak other languages and force everyone else to speak Mandinka, an act of utter rudeness in the eyes of the highly multilingual and adaptive Baïnounk Gubëeher.
 When asked about what language the 'worst teacher' would speak, only one person in 14 did not say 'Mandinka', which reflects the unwillingness to enter into situations of knowledge exchange with anyone perceived as Mandinka.
 Somehow Mandinka have taken the role of social and cultural nemesis, laden with negative stereotype and actively excluded from the social and cultural sphere, due to fears of cultural takeover and pollution as well as deviant behaviour in terms of work ethics.",,set11,Alexander Cobbinah

Williams (1936:187-206) extensively describes male initiation of Kerake (Nmbo) people, and the rituals appear to be tribally or village based. Membership to tribe and village are patrilineally traced, much like language. So Nen speakers are likely to have been involved in the knowledge domain with other Äkämär, who are ostensibly licensed Nen speakers. Unfortunately, neither of us know much about women's private circles. EK has heard about neighbouring Keraki women having gatherings where older women taught secret words of power to younger women, but does not know whether this included non-Keraki women. We understand of Idi speakers (Dibläg tribes people) is that they are considered culturally distinct from the Kerake/Äkämär/Nambu branch speakers, and so we are lead to believe that Dibläg have their own distinct set of esoteric and ritual knowledge. 

Church is a significant community space today, but again, these are organised on a village basis. Sometimes there are larger gatherings that span multiple villages, such as the women's fellowship held every few years - but this is something that only began with a specific missionary in the 1980s as far as we are aware. While this is a major event in the social calendar when it occurs, we feel it is yet to be established as a significant space of knowledge exchange across the Nen-Idi tribal divide.

That is to say, masters and novices for the most part would belong to the same patrilineally inherited language group. But as most individuals were and are multilingual, with repertoires for both groups often including Burarra and Yolngu Matha, it’s plausible that both languages would have been used in this domain at times.

Gender has a more significant effect: some religious classes may be open to only one gender, and families may be more reluctant to send their daughters to boarding schools or universities outside the town.

Ceremonies were organized by prominent family in each of several locations. Thus the participation of individuals in certain aspects of ritual life and knowledge transfer was linked by the same mechanism to social class, descent group, and place. The master/novice system described by Pilling (1978) was used to train the heads of a town's aristocratic household. While there was not a formalized distinction between life stages or ages, this system typically paired old men as masters with young men as novices. Gender also determined participation in the domain of ritual knowledge. While men played important roles in ceremonial gatherings (e.g. as priests reciting formulas or as hosts of gatherings), shamanism and ritual healing was the domain of women (Kroeber 1925). Both men and women thus participated in the transfer and use of ritual knowledge, albeit in different areas of community life.",,set32,Hannah Haynie

If we ask the Alorese people today, they would answer that the Alorese and the Adang are equal, although the answer might have been different in the past. The Adang are the older community so in a certain way they probably were considered superior in the past, as witnessed by the fact that the Alorese king’s clan Bungabali has Adang origin. Until the Dutch takeover of Alor in 1851, the Adang were the rulers. After the Dutch takeover, the ruler of the Adang village O’a, ceded power to the Alorese Bungabali lineage of Alor Besar village.

Regarding transfer of knowledge between Yurok and Karuk speakers, it appears that this was largely a reciprocal process involving the adaptation of ritual recitation formulas. For example, Conathan (2004) points out that in an interview with a man called Lame Billy, Kroeber noted that medicine (formulas for rituals or healing) could be learned from a Karuk friend and then translated from the Karuk language into Yurok by a ritual reader.

I believe knowledge exchange was not restricted to schools; Church must have played a role as well. I am less certain about handicraft and animal husbandry, but Saami would for instance also herd some goats, sheep and cows – occasionally for Scandinavians also.” 

SB: Boarding Schools + home environment in remote places (itinerant teachers) + Nomadic schools (exclusive to reindeer herders’ families).
Sweden: 
18th to late 19th century (missionaries’ era) 
The Diet of 1723 established a school system for the Sami population. 
The Board of Ecclesiastical Affairs in the Laplands was instituted in 1739. The idea was to create a corps of native Sami ministers to secure proficiency in Sami language. 
Sami schools were residential schools, organized in each of 7 parishes. The State provided teaching, boarding, clothing, lodging at no expense. The primary language of instruction was the Saami language, the Sámi language (Kortekangas & al., 2019, p.15). 
There were 1894 students enrolled in 6 Sami Schools during 1732-1850 (Henrysson et al. 1993).

In 1740, the recruitment policy for ministers changed. The Sons of Swedish ministers were seen as perfect candidates as they were bilingual. This new policy created a corps of large bilingual clerical families that frequently intermarried.
The Sami school didn’t play a role in the education of these new candidates. 
This decision not to recruit ministers among Sami population coincided with the emergence of a new itinerant teacher category: the catechists (Kortekangas & al., 2019, p.20).
End of the 18th century, the policy “Lapp shall be Lapp” was introduced to protect Sami reindeer herders from modernization and promote their nomadic lifestyle. 
In the early 1900s: As a result, nomadic schools (Nomadskola) were established in 1913 (only for reindeer-herding Sami families). The idea was to prevent Sami children of reindeer herding families to assimilate into the Swedish society (Belancic, 2020). In the nomadic schools, the children spoke Sámi with each other, although teachers used Swedish as a language of instruction (Jannok Nutti, 2010; Svonni, 2007). Other Sami children attended regular Swedish schools to assimilate into mainstream society (Belancic, 2020).",,set30,Richard Kowalik & Sacha Beck

The densest period of time for contact between Malta and Sicily was from 1050 to around 1550, because political, social and economic ties were practically exclusive. From 1550 onwards such contacts with Italy increased, and ties with the UK began in 1800 but became strong from about 1850 and are strongest today. However, statistics and testimonies for the Sicilian period are scarce, with the result that most of my responses to the questionnaire concern the present time period (roughly the last decades) when contact with Sicily is still ongoing, albeit in a much wider international framework. As regards language, contact with Sicilian died out with the coming of the Knights of St John who introduced Italian, both as an official and a spoken language for the educated classes. Moreover, today the Sicilian dialect is never spoken with foreigners by the Sicilians themselves.",,,,set06a,Joseph M Brincat

The earliest explicitly dated inscription from Tabelbala, in Judeo-Arabic, was made in 1322.

There is a theory, that that the appearance of Zazas in the areas where they live today seems to have been connected with waves of migration of Zazas from the highlands of Gīlān province in Iran (Deylam) during the 10th-12th centuries, as mentioned by Asatrian (1995). However, there is no extra-linguistic data on a possible migration of the Zazakî speakers. Whether and when they migrated from where or not is very hypothetical, which a) is based on morphosyntactic correlations between Zazakî and some languages of the Caspian Sea and b) erroneously goes back to the fact that the tribal names Dimilî and Daylam are the same (a basically refuted fallacy, which dates from the beginning of the 20th century).

This event left an indelible impact in the mind of the Santali people and the Santali society as a whole became aware of the importance of their own language and education.

Around the same time the Santali people started entering politics in significant numbers as they thought the communist government (Left front government assumed office in 1978 in West Bengal) would address their grievances sincerely. A sense of belonging grew among them. They thought education would help them eradicate their poverty and superstition and they can also contribute in nation building. The Santali language was recognized in the 8th schedule of the Constitution of India in 2003 by the government of India. In Sahitya AcaDEMEy Santali language was recognized and a separate section for Santali literature came into being. This also gave an impetus to Santali language and literature. Literature in ɔl ciki script started publishing in large numbers, Sahitya AcaDEMEy started fellowships for the Santali writers. Though setting up of tribal schools was legislated during this period, not much headway was made in this respect. Therefore, Bengali medium schools and English medium schools were the main points of entry in schools, leading to regular contact with the Bengali students. From 2006 onwards Santali was recognized as a subject of study in colleges of the areas where Santali people concentrate in large numbers.

SB: In 17th century: rather negative, opposition with Christianization, prevalence of Saami religion. 18th: gradually positive. Gradual integration into Christianity. Lindmark’s (2014) article about educational media in Sapmi shows that books were the symbol of Christianization, especially in the 18th century. He highlights how Saami people had different interpretations of these symbols, showcasing the different attitudes towards Christianization and generally towards Norwegian-Swedish people. Lindmark gives the example of two young men. The first one, Olof, had a vision in 1671 and saw the Devil in the appearance of a minister, who asked him to burn the books. 

The second one, Anders, had fever for several days, and had a vision in which the Devil appeared in traditional Saami garb and claimed his soul. As this man tried escaping, he offered the Devil a book. The Devil answered Anders that “I can read more than you can”. The first one, Olof, resisted the missionary efforts and became a spokesperson for the Saami community, to defend their culture. Anders, on the other hand, became a virtuous Christian. Until the end of the 17th century, Saami people showed willingness to defend their culture, and disagreed with Christian’s traditions. Saami people defended their culture and religion successfully until the end of the 17th century (…) There are accounts of verbal defense from more than one place. In Lycksele, Olof Sjulsson (one of the rare literate persons) sent a letter to the King of Swen in 1687 to ask permission to use the drum as a means of orientation in the mountains (Lindmark, 2006, p.70). He was trying to find a way to secure Saami religious practice (Lindmark, 2014, p.58). Erich Esskillsson, after being confiscated a drum, said: “they should know that we will never abandon the ways of our forefathers” (Lindmark, 2014, p.58). The maintenance of Saami traditions decreased at the end of 18th century, and Saami people assimilated largely to Christianity.",,set30,Sacha Beck & Richard Kowalik

However, their linguistic abilities are described as poor in the 17th century especially (Lindmark, 2014). It can be deducted that they spoke Saami as well as their native tongue, the Norwegian-Swedish language. Sources show that Saami people learned some Norwegian-Swedish language. 

With the time, they became proficient. At the end of the 18th century, literature shows the emergence of a body of fully Saami-speaking ministers and teachers (no more bilingual books were printed) (Lindmark, 2014, p.60). In nomadic schools later (early 20th), Norwegian-Swedish language was the language of instruction. The children spoke Sámi with each other, although teachers used Swedish as a language of instruction (Jannok Nutti, 2010; Svonni, 2007).",,set30,Sacha Beck & Richard Kowalik

set05-DKN96,set05-F,DKN96,"Uruava, Torau and Mono speakers. Papapana ancestors were part of a migration from the south of Bougainville in the mid–19th century which settled first in the area around Kieta and Arawa (the once Uruava-speaking area), moved north up the eastern coast to the contemporary Papapana-speaking area, Teperoi, before moving south again, with a possible halt in Vito (contemporary Torau-speaking area), before settling in Teperoi in the late–19th century. Although Ross (1988) placed Papapana in the Nehan-North Bougainville subgroup of Northwest Solomonic (containing the languages of northern Bougainville and Buka), there are similarities in lexicon and syntax which raise the possibility that Papapana is related more closely to Uruava, and perhaps even Torau and Mono. This is further supported by i) similar Papuan-induced grammatical changes in these four languages (Evans and Palmer 2011, Smith 2016), ii) 3 of the 6 Papapana clan names are cognate with Uruavan clan names (Palmer 2007), iii) the name Papapana could come from Uruava pa-papa-na ‘uncles (mother’s brothers)’ (Palmer 2007).

Teop speakers. It seems that the history of the Papapana community is further complicated by intermarriage and further migrations from the north, including Teop speakers. This is supported by i) one of the Papapana clan names is cognate with a Teop clan name, ii) historical records by a missionary in the 1930s comment that the houses in Teperoi showed traces of two different tribes – from Buka&the north, and from Kieta (south), iii) a trader’s travelogue comments that the village’s reconstruction was reinforced by immigrants from north Bougainville and east Buka. 

Certainly in 2011-2013, there was intermarriage between Papapana speakers and Torau and Teop speakers (as well as other closely related languages like Halia and Tinputz).

There are similarities between Papapana and all the Northwest Solomonic languages above but it would be difficult to establish whether e.g. similar/identical lexemes result from genetic inheritance or contact.

Buin, Motuna/Siwai and Nasioi speakers. Speakers of these South Bougainville languages were recruited to work in the plantations surrounding Teperoi in the early 20th century. There are families in some of the Papapana villages like Maras and Kokoi, whose ancestors were Motuna or Buin speakers and who bought/were given Papapana land because they worked in the surrounding plantations. In 2011-2013 there were a number of intermarriages with Buin, Motuna/Siwai and Nasioi speakers, as well as Rotokas. This contact could have contributed, along with Rotokas, to the partial shift from left-headedness to right-headedness in Papapana (Smith 2016). There are also words in Papapana which are similar/identical to Rotokas but I don't know the direction of influence.",,,,set05,Ellen Smith-Dennis

From the 14th to the mid 16th century immigration from Sicily was very strong.

It increased during the times of the Knights of St John, but so did the presence of ""continental"" Italians, French and Spanish persons. There was also a strong influx in the Risorgimento (1840-1870) which strenghthened the position of Italian and introduced the genre of the historical novel, with its Romantic and patriotic ideals.

The Matabele established themselves in their new environment by subjugating the original inhabitants in the territory between the Limpopo and Zambezi rivers.

Exceptions include Chipaya people who moved to larger cities like Oruro and La Paz to live there more or less permanently. However, in comparison to those Chipaya people who remain within the village and thus constitute the Chipaya community, those who left are rather a minority and thus do not contribute to the overall contact patterns and phenomena of Chipaya-Aymara (language) contact. 
As already mentioned elsewhere, Chipaya people may regularly leave their village to be employed as seasonal workers on Chilean and Argentinian plantations. However, according to my reckoning, these seasonal workers do not contribute to Chipaya-Aymara language contact to a relevant degree, either. First, most (if not all) of these seasonal workers return to their village once their work on the plantation is done; and, second, the language used on the Chilean and Argentinian plantations is Spanish rather than Aymara (which is not used in Chile or Argentina).

The densest period of time for contact between Malta and Sicily was from 1050 to around 1550, because political, social and economic ties were practically exclusive. From 1550 onwards such contacts with Italy increased, and ties with the UK began in 1800 but became strong from about 1850 and are strongest today. However, statistics and testimonies for the Sicilian period are scarce, with the result that most of my responses to the questionnaire concern the present time period (roughly the last decades) when contact with Sicily is still ongoing, albeit in a much wider international framework. As regards language, contact with Sicilian died out with the coming of the Knights of St John who introduced Italian, both as an official and a spoken language for the educated classes. Moreover, today the Sicilian dialect is never spoken with foreigners by the Sicilians themselves.",,,,set06a,Joseph M Brincat

Kwoma commonly fought alongside, and against, different Kaunga-speaking groups (Ndu family) to their east from the beginning of the 19th century until the 1950s, and communicated with them in both Kaunga and Kwoma; there has also been substantial intermarriage between the Kaunga and Kwoma during the same period, which continues today. Segments of both groups also reqularly participated in each other’s rituals, which required a high level of understanding of the host’s language, though whether this always required bilingualism is difficult to say. More than one Kwoma clan today is also descended from Kaunga-speaking immigrants.

2. Prior to 1950, Kwoma frequently fought against Apukili speakers to their north. This is now a defunct group which spoke a different language. This has not yet been identified but was probably Kwanga (the language spoken by a large population to the north of the Kwoma). Kwanga is the language most closely related to Kwoma. Kwoma also participated in Apukili rituals on a regular basis and many men spoke Apukili and vice versa. Some Kwoma clans trace their descent from the Apukili. Kwoma also say that many of their rituals are Apukili in origin.

3. Between the 1880s and 1920s the Kwoma occasionally fought against Iatmul speakers (Ndu family) now located at Brugnowi village, with whom they today have an active trading relationship. But contact with the Brugnowi has been relatively slight compared to that historically with the Kaunga (see above), the Manambu, and speakers of Mayo (Tama family) and Ngala (see below). In addition, there has never been intermarriage between Kwoma and Brugnowi.

4. From the earliest remembered time times (c1800) up to the 1950s Kwoma fought alongside Mayo speakers of the Maio dialect (Tama family), whose settlements today are located to the west in the Yesan (= Yessan) Hills at Maio and Yesan (= Yessan) villages.  During the last third of the 19th century the people now located at those two villages shared the Washkuk Hills with Kwoma, and interacted with them intensively. Some Kwoma clans also trace their origins to immigrants from Mayo-speaking villages. Speakers of the Nukuma dialect of Kwoma had a similarly close relationship with speakers of the Yau dialect of the Mayo language, to their west.

5. Between c1820 and c1860 Kwoma shared the Washkuk Hills with a Ndu-speaking people named Ngala. They interacted socially and probably intermarried, and many spoke the other’s language since they frequently participated in each other’s rituals.

set20-DLB99,set20-F,DLB99,"A good number of the Santali people are basically migrant labours from their place of residence in the border areas of Bankura, Midnapur (later divided in three districts, viz. East Medinipur, West Medinipur and Jhargram), Purulia (erstwhile Manbhum) and Birbhum districts to southern parts of West Bengal (especially Hooghly, Howrah, Burdwan).
Majority of them still migrate seasonally, thrice or four times a year, duration of each time ranges from three to four weeks, in some cases four to six weeks. At the end of each season, they get back to their own places of residence.
Some have also settled permanently in the southern parts of West Bengal where Bengali speaking people are the majority, say, Hooghly, Howrah, South 24-Parganas and Nadia districts.

Of the many tribal problems, the greatest of all is poverty. It is a historical reality. The central Indian tribal areas were inhabited by many tribes, especially the Santali people. The industrial invasion, especially after the independence of India in 1947 and reorganization of the state borders in 1956 many tribes had to be displaced in the name of development and better administration. As a result, the Santali people like many other tribes were dispersed in many states including predominantly Bengali speaking West Bengal. While their earlier settlements were typically inhabited by the tribals, especially the Santali people their new settlements were in the mixed zones, inhabited by both the Santali and non-Santali (here mostly Bengali) people.  As a result of their dispersal means of livelihood were severely affected and they had no other alternative but to sell their labour to non-Santali people (mostly Bengali people) in the neighbouring and far off areas within West Bengal. A tribe like the Santals became labours from hunter-gatherers, labours in the agricultural fields, rice mills, and recently in construction sites. The result was the emergence of contact situation. Moreover, for their needs they have to visit local shops and weekly markets owned and run by the Bengali people. In schools and colleges, the Santali children, boys and girls have to mix and interact with the Bengali boys and girls as the schools and colleges enroll both Bengali and Santali wards, except a handful tribal schools which are meant for the tribal students. Hence outside their home domain they always have to interact with the Bengali people for any kind of engagement. Language Contact is therefore the norm and bilingualism and sometimes trilingualism is regular among the Santals. Though bi-/trilingualism is rampant it does not necessarily lead to language shift and that can be illustrated by the decennial growth of Santali speakers in West Bengal, as also in India. this type of bi-/trilingualism is described as 'non-competing and non-conflicting type of grass-root bilingualism' (Srivastava 1977) or 'functional bilingualism' (Abbi 1986) Actually in a multilingual country like India where bi-/multilingualism is the norm contact does not necessarily create a hindrance to language maintenance as here 'language maintenance is the norm and shift is an exception' (Pandit 1977:9)",,,,set20,Arun Ghosh

Considering that many of the spouses, escpecially the wives come from outside the village, and considering that Mandinka speaking areas are situated relatively close to Djibonker, this asks for an explanation. 
In the Myfyr Prys questionnaire, 12 of 14 participants replied to the question: ""Languages spoken by the worst friend for sons or daughters"" with 'Mandinka'. 11 of 14 replied to the question after 'worst spouse' with 'Mandinka'. None stated 'Mandinka' when asked after best spouse or best friend for son or daughter. The stigma attached to Mandinka seems to actively inhibit friendships and marriages. Apart from being generally considered as lazy, Mandinka also are frequently described as crooked and untrustworthy, to te extent that they are activley excluded from the local space. 
One of our project members brought a Mandinka-speaking spouse to an adjacent village and he was met by mistrust and hostility.

However, the Chipaya language is not used by outsiders because the Chipaya were socially looked down upon by their Aymara (and Quechua) neighbours who are agriculturalists and pastoralists, while the Chipaya traditionally pursue an acquatic-based lifestyle of hunting, fishing and gathering. 
As outside activities, such as trade, are traditionally pursued by men, most of them are/were bilingual in Chipaya and Aymara, while women are responsible for domestic tasks and usually show a lower level of Chipaya-Aymara bilingualism. The generation of men that today is (roughly) between 50 and 70 years old is often trilingual in Chipaya, their native language, Aymara, the traditional contact language, and Spanish in which they were formally educated. Women of the same age cohort are often not trilingual and may not have command of Aymara and/or Spanish.

Duwai could also be seen as Eastern Bade.
Note that oral tradition of the Bade claims common origin with Ngizim. This can be corroborated, if we make the assumption that linguistic similarity implies common origin, or at least a long period of shared history. Therefore, we can infer that at one time the ancestors of the modern speakers of Bade and Ngizim occupied a large part of what is now Yobe State as well as western Borno State.

While care is provided by all of the above categories, particularly important are mothers, mothers’ sisters, grandmothers and the peer group (from around age 2).  Young children are cared for by parents, especially mothers, mothers' sisters (who are considered mothers), grandmothers, other adults (most likely female), and older children. Researchers in northern Australia have noted the contemporary importance of the 'kid mob' – i.e. groups of children spending time together away from communal areas and from adult social activities – and this is assumed to have been the case pre-colonially also. Loakes et al (2013): ""In Indigenous Australian communities, older children not only play with and interact with younger children, but are also expected to take on some responsibility with respect to looking after them in the community. This means that for many older children, a large proportion of their daily interactions are likely to take place with other children"". Hamilton (1981), in her study of Burarra child-rearing practices, notes that children usually stay with caregivers for the first 18–24 months of life, but from ~2 are expected to ""expected to adapt rapidly to new circumstances, to accept the peer group as the most significant force in its daily life, and to look to other children rather than mother or father for support and learning experiences"" (1981: 100). These peer groups then develop into the more structured 'kid mobs' for children 5-9. To an extent, these groups are determined by common language and kinship ties (1981: 103), and remain important for older kids and adolescents.",,set29,Jill Vaughan

This may be partly due to the disruption of culture and harm done to individuals as a result of western educational movements that targeted children in the era of early European contact. In the latter part of the 19th century Yurok children were removed from their families by missionaries and later by government officials and sent away to schools. Both children and their families experienced trauma surrounding these separations, and this may explain, at least in part, the relative scarcity of documentation of children's lives. Parents clearly played a role in the care of small (<5 years old) children. However, it is less clear what other relationships and interactions involving small children were customary.",,set32,Hannah Haynie

set29-DLC03_DLC03-4,set29-F,DLC03_DLC03-4,Yes,DLC03_DLC03-4-yes,"Earlier comments regarding caregiving and the 'kid mob' apply here, I repeat these below:
While care is provided by all of the above categories, particularly important are mothers, mothers’ sisters, grandmothers and the peer group (from around age 2).  Young children are cared for by parents, especially mothers, mothers' sisters (who are considered mothers), grandmothers, other adults (most likely female), and older children. Researchers in northern Australia have noted the contemporary importance of the 'kid mob' – i.e. groups of children spending time together away from communal areas and from adult social activities – and this is assumed to have been the case pre-colonially also. Loakes et al (2013): ""In Indigenous Australian communities, older children not only play with and interact with younger children, but are also expected to take on some responsibility with respect to looking after them in the community. This means that for many older children, a large proportion of their daily interactions are likely to take place with other children"". Hamilton (1981), in her study of Burarra child-rearing practices, notes that children usually stay with caregivers for the first 18–24 months of life, but from ~2 are expected to ""expected to adapt rapidly to new circumstances, to accept the peer group as the most significant force in its daily life, and to look to other children rather than mother or father for support and learning experiences"" (1981: 100). These peer groups then develop into the more structured 'kid mobs' for children 5-9. To an extent, these groups are determined by common language and kinship ties (1981: 103), and remain important for older kids and adolescents.",,set29,Jill Vaughan

From there, what would become the Aymara language proper would expand further south, and reach the altiplano of Bolivia in the Late Intermediate Period of the cultural chronology of the central Andes that began around 1000 AD (1000 years BP). This date thus forms the terminus post quem for the onset contact with Uru and Chipaya, which is usually tacitly assumed to have been established in situ at the point of Aymara expansion. A recent alternative view shifts the consolidation of Aymara on the altiplano back in time by several hundred years, up to the times of the Inca empire in the 14th and 15th centuries AD.

The densest period of time for contact between Malta and Sicily was from 1050 to around 1550, because political, social and economic ties were practically exclusive. From 1550 onwards such contacts with Italy increased, and ties with the UK began in 1800 but became strong from about 1850 and are strongest today. However, statistics and testimonies for the Sicilian period are scarce, with the result that most of my responses to the questionnaire concern the present time period (roughly the last decades) when contact with Sicily is still ongoing, albeit in a much wider international framework. As regards language, contact with Sicilian died out with the coming of the Knights of St John who introduced Italian, both as an official and a spoken language for the educated classes.

set07-DLC0b,set07-F,DLC0b,"Although the Tjwa were previously in contact with the Ndebele and Kalanga people, they never lived side by side with them as the former lived a nomadic way of life. 

When the British settlers arrived in the 1890s significant adjustments in Land Tenure and Administration happened between 1890 and 1896 (cf. Fleming 1974: 59). The British South Africa Company administrators of the future Rhodesia colony passed the Order in Council to create “native reserves”, with Gwaai and Shangani piloting the project. The colonial government continued to take land from the indigenous communities through various land and labour legislation. In 1898, the Department of Native Affairs was formed: it consisted of native commissioners whose duty was to control the indigenous people in everything they did. The native commissioners’ primary responsibility was to administer the Land Apportionment Act of 1931 and the Land Husbandry Act of 1951implementation. The Land Apportionment Act (cf. Land Apportionment Act, No. 30, 1930) divided the land into European and African reserves and forcibly removed the San people from the forest to which they were spiritually attached. The reserves assigned to the indigenous people were largely barren and marginal lands (cf. Wilson 1923: 88-89). According to Meredith (2002: 113), a decade after the arrival of the white colonists, approximately 16 million hectares had been taken by the colonial government from the indigenous people. 

The Tjwa people were part of the indigenous people who were relocated to the reserves far away from the forest, depriving them of their foraging grounds and subsistence strategies. Hunting wildlife became illegal over the next few years and the colonial administrators established rules which forbade snaring, mass-driving, and the digging of game pits. Incidentally, those were the methods most in use among the Tjwa people when hunting. For the colonial government, hunting was not a means of subsistence but a “fair chase” exercise, more of a personal taste and not so much a pursuit of food, certainly not a way of life (Haynes 2014: 110).

The resettlement of the Africans from areas designated as ‘game reserves’ was implemented across the nation. The colonial government argued that human beings and wildlife could not live together. Barriers such as fences were used to protect wildlife from the indigenous people. When Wankie was declared a game reserve in 1928, the Tjwa people were not immediately evicted to the reserves. The resettlement of the indigenous people was formalised in the Land Apportionment Act of 1930. The game reserve was later upgraded to the status of the national parks in 1949.",,,,set07,Admire Phiri

The contemporary situation thus likely represents to some extent a continuation of contact in the past. However, given that it might have time after first contact for the Aymara contact to penetrate into language use inside the local community, and that an alternative emerging view postdates the arrival of Aymara in the region by several hundred years, we believe that the greatest opportunities are to be sought some time after the Aymara expansion, plausibly in historic times and even in the very recent past, which we will use in the following as the basis for filling the questionnaire.",,set16,Katja Hannß & Matthias Urban

As I mentioned before, there is little evidence of mixed communities (such as on Kodiak, with Alutiiq and Aleut people from ca. 1000-800 BP), and those mixed communities did not stay mixed, i.e. there was cultural assimilation.

Bengali language has three pronouns in the second person, one, tui for proximate and inferior, tumi for general and apni for distant and honour.

Regarding gender, women and men traditionally carried out different subsistence activities and may have therefore interacted primarily with different segments of the local community. Women were prohibited from entering men's sweat houses. Certain occupations (e.g. healer) were restricted by gender. In short, there are many gender differences that shaped individuals' experiences in the local community. It is unclear, though, how these differences might have impacted language in Yurok communities.
An important distinction seems to have revolved around wealth. Wealthy families enjoyed a different lifestyles and greater community prestige than less wealthy families, and while Yurok wealth distinctions may not have been as formalized as class systems in many other human societies, they had significant consequences for community involvement. Wealthy families, for example, acted as hosts of ceremonial gatherings (see Kroeber 1925, 40 and Pilling 1978, 141). While participation at these community events was not limited based on wealth/incipient class or on the other characteristics enumerated above, the social position of wealthy individuals at these community gatherings would have differed from others in the community (e.g. in their provision of feasts and displays of wealth). Buckley (1984) describes two registers in Yurok, associated respectively with high and low class. The ""wo·ogey speech"" or high register was said by Buckley (1984) and Pilling (1978) to be used by wealthy families to index their high social status. Buckley describes this speech as involving more complex morphological, syntactic, and semantic structures than ordinary Yurok speech as well as differences in vowels and fricative consonants. This register, or perhaps an even higher register (Pilling 1989) was used in ceremonial speech.",,set32,Hannah Haynie

set16-DLC29,set16-F,DLC29,No,DLC29-no,"On the overall, I would say 'no' to this question but would like to modify it a bit. Traditionally, women (all over the rural Andean Altiplano, not just in Chipaya) are responsible for taking care of the house and the children. Thus, Chipaya women do not travel to La Paz as frequently as the Chipaya men but Chipaya women certainly are allowed to visit La Paz and other places with a predominantly Aymara population and do so. When visiting those Aymara-dominated places, Chipaya women interact with non-Chipaya men and thus, there is no gender-related code of conduct that would prohibit Chipaya women to interact with male outsiders (and vice versa). Also, Aymara women marry into the Chipaya community but there are also Chipaya women marrying Aymara men (thereby usually leaving the Chipaya community). My impression is that the latter is less frequent than the first scenario and Chipaya women leaving their community to live with their Aymara husbands are apparently violating the rule that the (eldest) daughter has to support her parents, and especially her mother, with all domestic tasks. However, these cases (i.e. a Chipaya woman marrying or living together with an Aymara man) are still attested. 

When it comes to class, the Aymara population of the villages surrounding the Chipaya community hardly differ from the Chipaya themselves with respect to their economic status, so there is no notable economic or class-related difference between the Chipaya people and their equally rural Aymara neighbours. That is, when the Chipaya socialise with the Aymara population from the neighbouring villages, no differences in class are observable as virtually everybody belongs to the same class (roughly speaking, peasants). Hence, the answer to the question would rather be 'no' again. It is only when Chipaya people visit places with a larger population and hence a more stratified society that class starts playing a role, as is the case in La Paz, for instance. In this case, Chipaya people do tend to interact with the lower-class Aymara people rather than with middle- or upper-class Aymara people. However, the same observation holds for the rural Aymara population who likewise interacts with the lower-class Aymara population rather than with middle- or upper-class Aymara people. That is, it is the economic status that determines the kinds and types of social interaction more than ethnicity.",,set16,Katja Hannß & Matthias Urban

Papapana ancestors were part of a migration from the south of Bougainville in the mid–19th century which settled first in the area around Kieta and Arawa (the once Uruava-speaking area), moved north up the eastern coast to the contemporary Papapana-speaking area, Teperoi, before moving south again, with a possible halt in Vito (contemporary Torau-speaking area), before settling in Teperoi in the late–19th century. Although Ross (1988) placed Papapana in the Nehan-North Bougainville subgroup of Northwest Solomonic (containing the languages of northern Bougainville and Buka), there are similarities in lexicon and syntax which raise the possibility that Papapana is related more closely to Uruava, and perhaps even Torau and Mono. This is further supported by i) similar Papuan-induced grammatical changes in these four languages (Evans and Palmer 2011, Smith 2016), ii) 3 of the 6 Papapana clan names are cognate with Uruavan clan names (Palmer 2007), iii) the name Papapana could come from Uruava pa-papa-na ‘uncles (mother’s brothers)’ (Palmer 2007).

Teop speakers. It seems that the history of the Papapana community is further complicated by intermarriage and further migrations from the north, including Teop speakers. This is supported by i) one of the Papapana clan names is cognate with a Teop clan name, ii) historical records by a missionary in the 1930s comment that the houses in Teperoi showed traces of two different tribes – from Buka&the north, and from Kieta (south), iii) a trader’s travelogue comments that the village’s reconstruction was reinforced by immigrants from north Bougainville and east Buka. 

Certainly in 2011-2013, there was intermarriage between Papapana speakers and Torau and Teop speakers (as well as other closely related languages like Halia and Tinputz).

There are similarities between Papapana and all the Northwest Solomonic languages above but it would be difficult to establish whether e.g. similar/identical lexemes result from genetic inheritance or contact.

Buin, Motuna/Siwai and Nasioi speakers. Speakers of these South Bougainville languages were recruited to work in the plantations surrounding Teperoi in the early 20th century. There are families in some of the Papapana villages like Maras and Kokoi, whose ancestors were Motuna or Buin speakers and who bought/were given Papapana land because they worked in the surrounding plantations. In 2011-2013 there were a number of intermarriages with Buin, Motuna/Siwai and Nasioi speakers, as well as Rotokas. This contact could have contributed, along with Rotokas, to the partial shift from left-headedness to right-headedness in Papapana.

set16-DTR03_DTR03-1,set16-F,DTR03_DTR03-1,No,DTR03_DTR03-1-no,"One difference concerns sex. It is usually the men doing the trading as most trade occurs outside the village of Santa Ana de Chipaya and most outwards activities are accomplished by men. That is, in order to participate in any trading activity, the Chipaya people have to leave their village and go to one to of the larger cities. Travelling 'abroad', however, is rather associated with males. However, Chipaya women are by no means forbid to travel to the places where trade takes place and thus can and do travel to e.g. Oruro or La Paz to purchase goods. This is more of an interesting observation on the side: within the Aymara community, trade is firmly in the hands of women. That is, practically all stands on a market are run by Aymara women. If a stand is run by a man, it is clear that he has no female relative who could run the stand for him.
The second difference concerns literacy. Illiteracy is still relatively common even among the middle Chipaya generation. Thus, for large-scale trading activities, like selling cattle, the Chipaya community may choose a man (here, sex plays a role again) who is literate so they may not get cheated in selling their surplus cattle. This is an official function. The chosen man may even be a young one but here, the ability to read and write overrides potential restriction live age may put on taking on official duties",,set16,Katja Hannß

Long-distance trade relations usually were important mostly to get exotic valuables for local elites. But even if we accept that the notion of ""trade"" is relevant for prehistory, the answer strongly depends on whose point of view one adopts. Alfredo Torero has maintained that Aymara served as a trade language during the Middle Horizon, when the Wari and Tiwanaku cultures flourished (the latter being altiplano-based), though the implied  association of Aymara is more with Wari than with Tiwanaku. This is not a commonly accepted theory however. If there is some truth to it, then we could say that commercial interactions involving Aymara speech might have started as early as 600 AD already. At least this would give a broad terminus post quem for such contacts.

Some Sicilian men who marry a Maltese girl and work in Malta usually become fluent in English in about three years by taking lessons and oral practice, and maybe fairly fluent in Maltese in about five years.

Apparently the social group in which Maltese persons are in contact with dialect-speaking Sicilians is that of fishermen. Nowadays many Sicilians have opened pizzerias and trattorias in Malta, but they tend to use the dialect only among themselves, not with the Maltese.

Chipaya women are less frequently involved in trade-related travelling (although they are perfectly entitled to travel). Depending on the nature of the goods purchased, Chipaya men may primarily interact with Aymara women when visiting the local markets in e.g. Oruro or La Paz because running a market stand is a typical female task within the Aymara community. These stands offer a wide variety of products, from food stuff to clothing and household appliances. However, contact, of course, also involves contact with Aymara men, e.g. when the Chipaya want to purchase items typically associated with men and thus traded by these, such as technical equipment.  
Social class is also factor that comes in but is not specific of the Chipaya people. That is, a lower-class Aymara person has probably as much possibility to get into contact with a middle-or upper-class Aymara person as a Chipaya person. As the Chipaya people are economically less potent, they usually interact with lower- or lower middle-class Aymara than with socially higher-ranking Aymara people.

For Chipaya, we consider possible that commercial interactions may have happened with people from two different regions, even though what we can see is only the faintest evidence that is *suggestive* of such contacts, but does not prove it.

First, speakers of highland languages: Puquina, and later also Quechua. Puquina was an autochthonous language of the altiplano, and many linguists like to associate it with the powerful Tiwanaku territory that underheld extensive trading networks (caravan-based) in all directions from their capital on the shores of Lake Titicaca. This would have happened in a timeframe of approx. 600-1000 AD, and possibly continued after the DEMEise of Tiwanaku. Later, as Quechua became established in the altiplano, possibly due to Inca expansion, interaction with speakers of Quechua is also a real possibility.

Contact between the Otomi and Nahuatl began in the 10th century. At the beginning of contact, Nahuatl must have been influenced by the Otomi since it was the dominant culture. However, as the Otomi were subdued by the Aztecs, the roles were reversed and from the 13th century, Nahuatl became the dominant language until the Spanish arrived in the 15th century (Hekking y Bakker 2010: 31).",,,,set17,Rosnátaly Avelino

However, and as outlined here and elsewhere, Chipaya women do participate in trading activities as well, only less frequently than men. This section focuses on trading with the Aymara people which means that the Chipaya have to leave their village and this is traditionally and typically the men's task. However, small-scale trading within the Chipaya village, e.g. selling on products delivered by the monthly lorry, is done by women. Often, they have little shops, sometimes mere windows from their houses, where they sell on products brought from Oruro. This behaviour is in line with what can be observed in the rest of the (Central and Southern) Andes: trading is usually done by women.",,,,set16,Katja Hannß

Nevertheless, it is difficult to estimate very accurately, since the United States Census does not share the exact numbers of Garifuna and Garifuna speakers with the general public.

Age is certainly a factor here: among the elderly Aymara population, the number of native-like speakers is higher than among the middle and younger generations and therefore, considering only elderly Aymara people the answer might as well have been 'fairly high proportion'.

set11-OH1,set11-F,OH1,Yes,OH1-yes,"The historical documentation suggests that the contact between established populations and Mandinka in the wake of the Madinka expansion between the 13th and 15th century was quite impacting and led to societal and economic restructuring. While the ruling elite in the Mande heartland in Mali converted to Islam already in the 4th century, Mande peasants and warriors who led the expansion continued to adhere to traditional forms of religion. The conversion of Mandinka (and assimilated local populations) established in Senegambia started only in the 17th century and was not accomplished until the 20th century (Toby Green 2011 & 2019). Religious tensions were exacerbated during the Mandinka Jihads that occurred in the Senegambia region at the end of the 19th century led by Fode̒ Kaba. The cultural and religious assimilation of autochtonous populations was thus not always peaceful, although the cultural and identitarian flexibility that characterises the populations of Casamance probably facilitated assimilation greatly, promising economic integration into powerful trade networks. Bainounk most probably never was a monolithic ethnic configuration, with each kin-based group enjoying considerable autonomy, some assimilating - and occupying positions of power withing the Mande world - and some resisting it vehemently. The elite of the powerful Kasanke state is usually described as Mandinguized Bainounk and until today the Bainounk speaking groups in Middle Casamance and Southern Gambia exist within a Mandinka societal framework and use Mandinka as lingua franca. Local tradition states that many nowadays ethnic Mandinka indeed have Bainounk ancestry. 
 Little detail is known about the linguistic and social history of the group that speaks what is now called Baïnounk Gubëeher, but local tradition does not relate a Mandinka domination or influence in the past. Independent of historic facts they present themselves as part of the groups that actively resisted cultural and economic assimlation into Mandinka statehood.
 I find the socio-historic models of Kopytoff and Scott helpful in interpreting the Mandinka- Bainounk contact. Scott's work deals mainly with South-East-Asian non-state population, but his characterization of state-avoiding population fit well with the social reality encountered nowadays in Western Lower Casamance (between Ziguinchor and the seabord): mobile kin-based groups with low hierarchies, high levels of multilingualism, flexible identities and oral cultures, who actively avoid statehood in defence of more autonomous modes of production. The subregion (of Western Lower Casamance), although deeply implicated in and affected by the Atlantic slave trade, has indeed successfully maintained distance to any state structures that have tried to assimilate the populations, be it the Mande states, the Portuguese and the French colonial state and the senegalese nation state through guerilla, armed resistance and since the 80s armed separatist movements. The fragmented geography of tidal marshlands and dense forests, hard to penetrate and impossible to control by outsiders has helped in this respect.
 For Scott, the so-called shatter zones at the fringes of usually rather predatory empires are intrinsically constituted as non-state areas, where refugee population who have escaped statehood concentrate and maintain their autonomous lifestyle avoiding forced labour and taxation. Kopytoff describes African societies as characterised by an administrated core and a fragmented, small-scale periphery. The seabord of Casamance is clearly a frontier society, that has maintained its egalitarian, non-state character (in terms of Scott's shatter zone). 
 The opposition and deep mistrust of Baïnounk Gubëeher and neighbouring Joola groups inhabiting Western Lower Casamance could plausibly be explained by these state vs. non-state dynamics. This would explain the fears of Mandinka colonization and assimilation and the avoidance of contact with populations identified as such and the stigma attached to other Bainounk populations perceived as linguistically and culturally assimilated. 
 This potential fault line between Baïnounk Gubëeher and Mandinka is further deepened by further economic and cultural differences. The perception of Mandinka as layz and unmanly expressed by Baïnounk Gubëeher speakers of Djibonker is clearly due to differing gender roles and gender-associated activities, as well as differences in subsistence. The Mandinka insistence on peanuts as main crop (alongside rice and other crops), is perceived as an unacceptable imposition, as interviewees have stated clearly. Rice is perceived as central to conceptions of identity and plays a central role in religious rites, where sheafs of rice and rice flour are used as offerings to the ancestors and other spirits. From a social organization point of view, in Baïnounk Gubëeher society agriculture is practiced by both men and women, with a strict division of labour: men do the muscle work to do with digging and field preparation, while women do bodily exhausting but less force-dependent work of planting and harvesting. The perception of Baïnounk Gubëeher informants is that Mandinka men do not engage at all in agriculture (this might be a cliche̒ though), and let women do all the work, which is considered completely unacceptable and contrary to their accepted gender roles by the Baïnounk Gubëeher. Typically male activities in Mandinka society would involve religious and political activities and trade - both of which are exercised by men and women in Baïnounk Gubëeher society.
 I believe that these differences in social organization have acted as a barrier to linguistic influence.

 I believe that these differences in social organization have effectively functioned as a barrier to language contact between Mandinka and Baïnounk Gubëeher. The substantial grammatical and lexical differences between Baïnounk Gubëeher, heavily influenced by Joola languages on all levels of linguistic description, and Baïnounk Gujaher as spoken in Agnack Grand east of Ziguinchor, a language that is quite well integrated with the surrounding Mandinka populations, could thus be explained on this basis. Speakers of Gujaher from this community are by default multilingual in Mandinka and I suspect that apart from the obvious influences on the lexical level, the contact between Gujaher and Mandinka as part of speakers' multilingual repertoires has triggered profound changes in the noun class system, leading to a smaller number of noun classes (Mandinka is a non-noun class language) and the development and spread of a semantic, animacy based agreement system, as opposed to a purely morphosyntactic agreement system as witnessed in Baïnounk Gubëeher, which it shares with the adjacent Joola languages.

During their contact, there was a major volcanic eruption in the early period (ca. 3000 BP) that inhibited contact between the Eastern Aleutians and everything to the east, including Kodiak, Kenai, and Prince William Sound, thus isolating different Aleut groups and directing Aleuts on Kodiak and Kenai eastward rather than westward in their contacts with other groups (cf. Berge forthcoming).  Between 2000-1500 BP, changes in fish migration eliminated human populations on Kenai Peninsula; the assumption is that they migrated.  The first evidence of the Eyak in the Yakutat area (their present day home) dates from about 1200 BP.",,set33,Anna Berge

This goes so far as that there is a self-proclaimed 'Uru-Chipaya nation', seeking to unite all groups that speak or used to speak an Uru-Chipaya language: this includes the Chipaya themselves (the only group where an Uru-Chipaya language is still spoken), the Uru of Lake Titicaca (both on the Bolivian and Peruvian side) as well as the Uru-Murato (or: Morato), whose language became extinct without any substantial documentation.

The main borrowings of which he is aware are the many personal and other proper names Kwoma now use that derive from Manambu. This transfer of names is an old practice but increased after the 1920s when contact between the two language groups increased in intensity. One occasion when proper names were transferred historically (i.e. before about the 1920s) was during the settlement of long-standing feuds between different groups. This involved exchanging ritual, such as overmodelled skulls or carvings, along with their proper names and ‘ownership’ of the spirits they represented. One Kwoma name that derives from the Manambu is the village name ‘Bangwis’. This derives from the name of a ritual sub-division at Avatip and was given to the modern-day Bangwis village people in the late 1920s by a Manambu political leader. He gave them this name to enable them to distinguish themselves, in the eyes of the government, from eht people who adopted the name ‘Washkuk’, and are today located at Washkuk village, after they killed two native policemen visiting the settlement at which both factions were located in revenge for the rape of the wife of a ‘Washkuk’ man. These killings and their aftermath are described in J.K. McCarthy’s book Patrol Into Yesterday. Kwoma are unconcerned about the Manambu origin of many of their proper names, just as they are unconcerned about the fact that many of the personal names they use today are of Biblical or other Western origin.

set11-OI7,set11-F,OI7,Neither positive nor negative,OI7-3,"This is ambivalent, as the ability to adapt and shift between languages is a central aspect of using language in Djibonker. Multilingualism is clearly the norm, and speakers are very comfortable to have multilingual conversations and actively pride themselves on their ability to do so. 
 (For an in-depth study of multilingual language use in Djibonker consult Weidl, M.M., 2021. The role of Wolof in multilingual conversations in the Casamance: Fluidity of linguistic repertoires. Köppe, R. - based on the phd thesis with the same title)
 When asked about the issue, many speakers of Baïnounk Gubëeher profess an overt aversion towards code-switching and mixing and state that too many loans make the language less pure, but in practice the same persons most certainly practice extensive code-switching and borrowing without any qualms only moments later (or even while badmouthing linguistic transfer). I suspect that these essentialist attitudes serve political purposes and are part of a certain set of ideologies that are part of the colonial and post-colonial perspective propagated in the media, government publications and the education system, but which have little to do with people's experiences of their linguistic (and cultural) surroundings and behaviours. The attitudes reflect what people think ought to be the case, but they happily engage in practices contrary to these assumptions that ar actually necessary for society to function.
 The integration of material from French is very common and not usually sanctioned. The switching between Baïnounk Gubëeher and Wolof, or the use of Wolof vocabulary is more frowned upon, as Wolof is considred by conservative speakers as a foreign and potentially hostile element, usually blamed for perceived language shift in young people and alleged loss of competence in Baïnounk Gubëeher. Contact with Joola languages accounts for the heaviest manifestations of contact induced language change, from phonology, to verbal morphology (person/number, TAM), noun class system and pragmatic structures. These phenomena are not generally registered as foreign, neither as polluting the language, only occasionally someone would remark that such and such item is 'actually' Joola, and make a show of replacing it with some more supposedly authentic Bainounk word. The numerous - probably centuries-old - lexical transfers from Portuguese-based Casamance Creole are also generally considered as authentically Bainounk.
 Obvious Mandinka transfers into Baïnounk Gubëeher would not be socially acceptable. and definitely judged as inappropriate. Speakers of other Bainounk lects or languages are often ridiculed for having incorporated Mandinka vocabulary and consequently their Bainounkness is put into doubt. This supposedly heavy Mandinguization is more often than not based on cliche̒s. I have heard people call varieties as Mandinguized, which they know almost nothing about, but whose speakers they consider as less Bainounk than them. In these cases any perceived difference in terms of language and culture from themselves was attributed to outside pollution and blamed on Mandinka, regardless of any linguistic or historical facts. Speakers with these attitudes also systematically ignore or downplay the transfers and contacts that have shaped their own language and culture (which is in turn highlighted by speakers of the other Bainounk varieties, who in turn consider themselves as bastions of linguistic and ethnic purity and all the others as mixed and diluted).",,set11,Alexander Cobbinah

Although speakers may evaluate the variants of other dialect groups as inferior to their own, the existence of these variants is seen as important and is frequently noted – so I'd consider this to be a positive attitude.

The Aymara form part of the multi-ethnic state of Bolivia and officially are just one group among several others. However, between 2006 and 2019, Evo Morales of the MAS party (MAS = movimiento al socialismo, 'Movement towards Socialism') held the presidency of Bolivia. As he is an Aymara, during his government the Aymara people experienced a very active representation of their interests by Morales himself (something he has been repeatedly criticised for) and in a sense, Bolivia was ruled according to Aymara ideas and ideals during that time.

For these stays, they have so-called putukus, conical huts build from stone or adobe bricks that give them shelter while being away from their permanent houses in the village.

The overall relationship between Chipaya and Aymara people can be described as rather negative to hostile: the Aymara despise the Chipaya people for their largely non-pastoralist, non-agriculturalist lifestyle, while the Chipaya claim that the Aymara stole their land.

The expansion of Mongol rule caused migration of Mongolic and Sinitic speakers to the region. In the Tongren area of Qinghai Province where Wutun and Bonan are spoken, the local Mongolic and Sinitic speakers, the ancestors of Bonan and Wutun communities, were organized into hereditary border guard units whose work was to patrol the borders of Chinese Empire. It is likely that Wutun and Bonan speakers worked together that time.
