The Williams ethnography already mentions villages in the 1910-20s, so at least for the last 100 years people have been living in villages. Perhaps the population increase in the 20th century has also contributed to larger village units becoming a more typical form of local community. Today, people still spend a lot of time in their garden places, and we believe this may have been the more common form of local community prior to the village system (see Kashima 2020: 37-39). Garden places can consist of a couple of nuclear families (see answers in DLB)",,,
