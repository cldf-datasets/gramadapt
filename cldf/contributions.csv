BA,BA: What is the overall attitude that Focus Group people have towards Neighbour Group people in domain X?,"# [](ContributionTable?__template__=property.md&property=name#cldf:BA)

Authors: [](ContributionTable?__template__=property.md&property=contributor#cldf:BA)

## Goal

In this question we aim to capture a general attitude that the Focus Group have towards the Neighbour Group within the domain. People's attitudes towards others have consequences for various aspects of interaction, and the rationale of attitudes generally are covered in the B-Set of questions.

This question overlaps somewhat with question [S5](S5.md) which asks about the friendliness between peoples of the Focus and Neighbour Groups. While question [S5](S5.md) concerns the nature of social ties between groups in terms of friendship, this question is concerned with a general belief about the other group in the abstract.


## Definitions

The scale is as follows:

- Very negative

## Examples

*Negative*: Chinese diaspora in the Solomon Islands have come predominantly in two waves, with the earlier wave being relatively established within the community of the capital Honiara. The relationship between locals and Chinese diaspora is complex, but there are a few aspects which would make this dynamic score a ""negative"" response to this question. There is little doubt that the relationship between Solomon Islanders on the one hand, and Chinese diaspora on the other, are not positive. [Moore](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Moore2008a) ([2008](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Moore2008a): 66) describes Solomon Islanders as having ""long-term smouldering resentments against the economic hold of the 'old' Chinese citizens"", but they are still viewed as part of the modern nation by virtue of having arrived during the British colonial era. The new diaspora who have arrived recently from the People's Republic of China are viewed in a much poorer light, and appear to be associated (in the eyes of Solomon Islanders) to the corrupt business practices of various Asian companies ([Moore](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Moore2008a) [2008](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Moore2008a): 65). Chinese businesses are seen to represent corrupt activities within the political and economic classes of the Solomon Islands. [Moore](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Moore2008a) ([2008](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Moore2008a): 82–83) reports that the 2006 rioters in Honiara distinguished between ""old"" and ""new"" waves of Chinese diaspora, where businesses run by the former were deliberately left untouched.

While the overall attitude of Honiarans towards the Chinese diaspora can be characterised as negative, we would choose the response ""negative"" rather than ""very negative"" due to the nuance displayed in discerning old vs new Chinese diaspora.


## Theoretical Support

We take positive/negative attitudes towards another as a factor that affects a person's openness to innovation. A person with a positive attitude towards their interlocutor is more likely to accommodate to them ([Giles](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Giles1978a) [1978](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Giles1978a); [Giles & Byrne](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:GilesByrne1982a) [1982](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:GilesByrne1982a)), and is also more likely to adopt innovations from them. A person with a negative attitude towards an interlocutor is less likely to accommodate. This negative attitude appears to result in divergence of maintenance of linguistic, cultural, and ethnic differences across groups ([Giles & Johnson](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:GilesJohnson1981) [1981](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:GilesJohnson1981); [Palomares et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:PalomaresEtAl2016a) [2016](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:PalomaresEtAl2016a)). Put more mechanistically, a person with a positive attitude towards another person is a node that is vulnerable to innovations in a social network ([Collar](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Collar2007a) [2007](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Collar2007a): 153), and a person with a negative attitude is a node that is less vulnerable.

For contact situations, then, a person who is positively oriented towards a person from another linguistic group is less likely to monitor and reject aspects of an out-group's linguistic output. Simplistically put, a positive attitude may suggest a greater likelihood of contact-induced transfer.

## Goal

This question aims to investigate whether there are any attitudes or beliefs present in this domain that may reflect inequalities in power. We frame the question around senses of superiority and inferiority to get to notions of “prestige” that are often invoked in discussions of language convergence and shift in particular.

## Definitions

The scale is as follows:

[](ParameterTable?__template__=question_template.md&codes_only#cldf:DEM18)

## Examples

- *Very superior*: Clearly stated beliefs that the Focus Group are better than the Neighbour Group in some way.
- *Superior*: Some stated beliefs that Focus Group are better than the Neighbour Group in some way.
- *Neither superior nor inferior:* e.g. there are no clear or obvious stated beliefs that Focus Group are better than the Neighbour Group in some way.
- *Inferior*: Some stated beliefs that Focus Group are not as good as the Neighbour Group in some way.
- *Very inferior*: Clearly stated beliefs that Focus Group are not as good as the Neighbour Group in some way.

## Theoretical & Empirical Support

Studies on language choices often utilise the concept of prestige as a motivating factor. A general finding is that people often use languages, varieties, and styles that help them access the prestige associated with that language.

What is prestigious, however, manifests itself differently across social contexts. For example, there is the valuing of prestige associated with formal institutions of power, often called *overt prestige*. [Labov](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Labov1972) ’s ([1972](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Labov1972)) seminal “fourth floor” department store study of New Yorker English is a classic demonstration of speakers accessing overt prestige. Another example is the use of English in traditionally non-English speaking countries. “English is perceived as a language of developed Western countries” by young educated Kazakhs and the use of English is associated with identification with the West ([Akynova et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:AkynovaEtAl2014) [2014](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:AkynovaEtAl2014): 229).

In contrast, the notion of *local prestige* revolves around values that may be particular and distinct to those around overt prestige(1). Local prestige may emphasise localness in direct opposition to standard varieties (e.g. [Coupland & Bishop](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:CouplandBishop2007) [2007](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:CouplandBishop2007) on various expressions found across the UK), they may be an expression of community root and ties (e.g. [Ventsel & Struchkova](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:VentselStruchkova2015) [2015](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:VentselStruchkova2015) on Sakha in the Republic of Sakha, Russia), or even linguistic expression of resistance (e.g. Spanish heritage-language learners’ appropriation of high- and low-prestige varieties in the USA, [Lefkowitz & Hedgcock](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:LefkowitzHedgcock2016) [2016](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:LefkowitzHedgcock2016)).

What seems to unify both forms of prestige is some stated belief around “better vs lesser” hierarchy judgement.

The notion of prestige appears to be present in contexts where there is some kind of perceived hierarchy, or when there is some social stratification in a society (this is rarely spelled out explicitly, but seemingly implied, e.g. [Grusky](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Grusky2015) [2015](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Grusky2015) in an encyclopaedia entry about social stratification). We have chosen the general terms “superiority and inferiority” as the dimension to tackle prestige. Given that the notion of prestige is a belief, we ask about possible hierarchy in terms of the subjective assessment of superior vs inferior.

In this questionnaire we treat overt prestige as one of the many factors that affect the use of certain linguistic variants and codes in any given context. Coming back to the example of Kazakhstan, [Akynova et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:AkynovaEtAl2014) ([2014](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:AkynovaEtAl2014)) also note that among the ways to use English by the young Kazakhs whom they investigated are insertion strategies to save time and provide specific meanings which cannot be expressed in Kazakh or Russian (ibid.: 231); that is, prestige is just one reason for young Kazakhs to speak English.

[^1] As [Meyerhoff](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Meyerhoff2011) ([2011](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Meyerhoff2011): 41–42) points out, the traditional notion of *covert prestige* as put forward by [Trudgill](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Trudgill1972) ([1972](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Trudgill1972)) is different to that of local prestige. Trudgill’s use of covert prestige refers to the mismatch between the stated ideals around language varieties versus what speakers were actually producing in speech. For example, a English speaker from Norwich states that local pronunciations of certain words are “better” than the Standard Southern British realisations, but in unmonitored speech would produce the Standard realisation. This, Trudgill argues, is evidence of covert prestige. In this questionnaire we have chosen not to consider this form of covert prestige, since we predict there are few studies that will have such evidence for the speech communities in our sample.

## Goal

This question tells us about stated norms around language use in specific social domains. The stated norm around language use may be reflections of various linguistic ideologies.

The answer to this question is treated as one of a number of factors that play a role in characterising language ideologies. This factor alone is likely unable to characterise the socio-cultural environment of language use. In combination with other socio-cultural factors, this variable may be indicative of differences in power (imagined or real), ideologies of linguistic homogeneity, and/or ideologies of linguistic differentiation.


## Definitions

- *The Focus Group language/The Neighbour Group language/Some other language*: So-called monolingual modes of interaction. These options are mutually exclusive, that is, if more than one language is used in interaction, please select the fourth option, ""This is highly contextual”.
- *This is highly contextual*: encompasses interaction in which more than one language is used, including but not limited to phenomena that come under the umbrella terms ""code-switching"" and/or ""code-mixing"".


## Examples

- *This is highly contextual*: [Di Carlo et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:DiCarloEtAl2019) ([2019](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:DiCarloEtAl2019)) note that different social domains often require different multilingual modes in multilingual communities of rural Africa. For example, monolingual patrimonial language may be prevalent in ritual performances like communications with shrines or ancestors, while contexts like the home do not require the use of particular languages and “present unconstrained multilingual contexts” (ibid.: 18). The family and kin domain would beget a “This is highly contextual” answer in this questionnaire, while the ritual domain would be one of the other options.
- *Knowledge Domain:* The use of Sanskrit in the “precosmopolitan period” of India was monopolised by ritual specialists such as the Āryas, and its use in domains outside the sacred were prohibited ([Pollock](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Pollock2006) [2006](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Pollock2006): 40). Pollock notes that in the Common Era while Sanskrit was used in liturgical, literary, and political discourse at the highest level, the norm was that the business of land or village tended to be conducted in non-Sanskrit languages (ibid.: 49). This distinction of languages by social domain may be taken as a reflection of ideologies where non-Sanskrit languages are associated with local and earthly concerns, while Sanskrit is not.

## Theoretical & Empirical Support

This question about stated language norms is an attempt to capture a small dimension of language ideologies within the contact scenario under investigation. Language ideologies have been argued as behaviour affecting beliefs that have consequences for social and linguistic structures ([Gal & Irvine](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:GalIrvine1995) [1995](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:GalIrvine1995); [Woolard](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Woolard2020) [2020](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Woolard2020)), and has been argued as a particularly relevant factor for outcomes of language contact. There are noticeable cases where ideologies of language and group differentiation seem to help keep certain linguistic structures distinct ([Gal & Irvine](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:GalIrvine1995) [1995](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:GalIrvine1995)). For example in the linguistically diverse Northwestern Amazon, [Chernela](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Chernela2013) ([2013](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Chernela2013)) describes how the devaluing of one's matrilect by East Tukanoan speakers makes spoken bilingualism very rare (though passive bilingualism is prevalent, as well as receptive multilingual interactions).

## Goal

This question aims to elicit an assessment of the social categories and/or communities of practices that are thought to be particularly relevant to contact in this social domain. It is related to question D3 concerning social categories.

This question is here in recognition of the fact that not all members of a speech community engage in contact, and that contact experiences differ, in part, based on one’s social background. The answers to this question will help us interpret the answers to the rest of the questionnaire, and which group of people the answers apply to. The answers to this question will also help provide a more nuanced picture of the socio-cultral particularities of a given contact scenario. The answers to this question may also potentially be relevant to understand whether contact-induced linguistic variation and change are likely to rise and spread in this domain.

See D3 for details on social categories.

Authors: [](ContributionTable?__template__=property.md&property=contributor#cldf:D11)

## Goal

By this question, we wish to investigate whether any group has the potential for greater influence over the other group(s) within this domain. Put another way, we are interested in power differences between and across groups. We take the existence of hierarchy between groups as a sign that power differences of some kind are likely to exist.


## Definitions

- *Influence is practically always exerted:* In essence, Focus Group people alone decide the terms.
- *Influence is very much exerted*: Focus Group people will have a say, and there is a good chance that they will get their way.
- *Influence is somewhat exerted*: Focus Group people may have a say, but it is not predictable whether they will get their way.
- *Influence is exerted very little:* Focus Group people may have a say, but it is unlikely that they will get their way.
- *Influence is practically never exerted:* Focus Group people are essentially excluded from decision making.

## Theoretical & Empirical Support

Many works in sociolinguistics and anthropological linguistics have presented data and analyses on linguistic variation as a means of negotiating power in situations where social hierarchies exist. For example, the common finding that women are more likely than men to speak standard varieties is analysed as a linguistic means of accessing social power (see [Romaine](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Romaine2008) [2008](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Romaine2008); [Rau et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:RauEtAl2009) [2009](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:RauEtAl2009) for the Yami of Taiwan).

The power associated with the variety may be related to so-called *overt prestige* in formal domain, such as the workplace. Power may also pertain to locally meaningful forms of influence, as is stated in the notion of *covert prestige* ([Trudgill](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Trudgill1972a) [1972](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Trudgill1972a); [Dodsworth](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Dodsworth2011) [2011](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Dodsworth2011) in the context of social class). In this case, the hierarchies may not be those pertaining to formal institutions and economic power, but valuing certain social meanings over others (e.g. [Salmon & Gómez Menjivar](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:SalmonGomezMenjivar2016) [2016](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:SalmonGomezMenjivar2016) on Belizean Kriol; [Toribio](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Toribio2000) [2000](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Toribio2000) on Dominican Republic Spanish). The key here is some conceptualisation of “better” vs “lesser” along some value axis.

Linguistic behaviours appear to be strongly affected when localised power differences exist between speakers of certain linguistic groups. For example, language stigmatisation is a characteristic of places where there is some kind of superior/inferior relationship stemming from economic, political, and other kinds of social power. Language shift often occurs when minority languages are viewed as being of lower prestige (cf. [Loureiro-Rodriguez et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Loureiro-RodriguezEtAl2013) [2013](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Loureiro-RodriguezEtAl2013); [Potowski](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Potowski2013) [2013](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Potowski2013)). On the other hand, places that have relatively similar kinds of powers in various domains have been observed as having egalitarian attitudes towards other languages, which in turn sustain environments conducive to multilingualism (e.g. [Singer & Harris](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:SingerHarris2016) [2016](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:SingerHarris2016) for Aboriginal northern Australia; [François](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Francois2012) [2012](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Francois2012) for Vanuatu). In this sense, this question is closely tied to the B-set of questions in this questionnaire (BA, BH, BI), which asks about speakers' beliefs and attitudes towards languages.

## Goal

The goal is this question is to discern whether special speech styles identified in D9 form a large part of speakers linguistic output.
## Definitions

For the purposes of this questionnaire, we define _speech styles_ as socio-semantically informed ways of speaking (e.g. [Bell](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Bell1984) [1984](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Bell1984); [Coupland](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Coupland2007) [2007](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Coupland2007): 2) in contrast to unmonitored and so-called _vernacular ways of speaking_.

The term _vernacular_ in Labovian sociolinguistics is a natural speech style, in opposition to monitored or standardised speech styles (Labov 1972, cf. Coupland 2009). [Coupland](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Coupland2016) ([2016](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Coupland2016): 410) summarises the notion of Labovian vernaculars as formally systematic, represent speaking in its most natural and least monitored conditions, and are viewed as the most consequential way of speaking for the study of language change.
## Examples

Examples of speech styles under the operational definition include:

- formal registers
- academic and legalese jargons
- the high variety in diglossic situations
- lects associated with ceremonial events
- kinship registers
- standard varieties (e.g. national standards)
- trade jargons

## Theoretical Support

Language contact effects through registers are uncommon in the literature, but given that registers are associated with certain kinds of domains (such as knowledge, domain, trade, family and kin) it is possible that registers are a pathway for adopting linguistic matter/patterns.

A famous example given by [Irvine and Gal](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:IrvineGal2000) ([2000](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:IrvineGal2000)) summarises a number of proposed pathways of how clicks entered the Nguni languages (of the Bantu family) such as Zulu and Xhosa via contact with Khoe languages. Irvine & Gal's proposals rests on Nguni-speakers' indexing Khoe clicks as ""foreign"", given the absence of these phones in Bantu languages. The route of relevance here is the gradual familiarisation of speakers' to clicks via the use of an avoidance register. The avoidance register *hlophina* requires lexical replacements that allow speakers to avoid uttering words and names that are taboo. The high number of avoidance register words containing clicks suggests this as the main pathway of click adoption by Nguni-speakers. Furthermore, by virtue of clicks indexing foreignness, Nguni-speakers were able to ""mobilised to express social distance and difference within"" by incorporating these phones into their repertoire.As some of the avoidance words lost their respectful index overtime due to ""pragmatic devaluation"" ([Errington](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Errington1988) [1988](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Errington1988)), these originally avoidance words became part of everyday vocabulary. [Herbert](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Herbert1990) ([1990](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Herbert1990)) suggest that the frequent use of clicks in the avoidance register (which was seemingly spoken by all adults in society) made the sounds familiar this making the wholesale adoption of Khoe words easier.

Citing a number of works, [Irvine and Gal](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:IrvineGal2000) ([2000](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:IrvineGal2000)) draw attention to Nguni and Khoi multilingualism. Speakers were likely multilingual in each other's languages through intermarriage, by becoming community members,  providing expertise services to one another (p.46).

Irvine and Gal's analysis presents the avoidance register as merely the entry point for clicks into the Nguni languages, and the true mechanism that caused people to use clicks in their speech was no pragmatics. It was because the avoidance register was such a large part of Nguni linguistic practice that is served as an impactful pathway for contact induced change.

## Goal

This question tries to capture the degree of formalization of exchange practices. Ceremonial exchanges are highly ritualised performative acts, and, as such, they are characterised by rules of behaviour, including linguistic behaviour, that are also highly conventionalised. For instance, different speech styles (e.g. monologic, dialogic, sung speech) may be associated with different phases of a ceremonial exchange ritual (cf. the description of the *po’oa* ceremony in the examples section, based on [Chernela](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Chernela2003) [2003](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Chernela2003)). Conversely, we surmise that gift exchanges, which result from the initiative of the individual may be less formalised from the point of view of associated linguistic interactions.

With this question we also aim at capturing the intensity of contact between Focus Group and Neighbour Group through practices of exchange. The higher the number of exchange practices between the groups, the greater the possibilities of interaction, hence the degree of contact. We may also assume that in communities where exchange across groups is only ceremonial, contact in this domain is less pervasive than in communities where, say, individual gift exchange also occurs across groups.
## Definitions

The scale is as follows:

- Is Exchange between Focus and Neighbour Group the individual’s initiative?
- Is Exchange between Focus and Neighbour Group an institutionalised procedure?
- Is Exchange between Focus and Neighbour Group part of a ceremonial event to which both communities participate?

## Examples

- YES for *individual initiative*: Most gift exchanges in contemporary WEIRD societies are the result of the initiative of individuals acting within their private sphere, but they are also tied to social norms and expectations that are widely shared in the community(-ies) of reference ([Yan](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Yan2012) [2012](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Yan2012)). Examples of these are birthday gifts and engagement ring giving.
- YES for *institutionalised procedure*: The *kula* is an example of institutionalised exchange*.*The *kula* is a complex system of exchange among the inhabitants of the Trobriand Islands of Papua New Guinea. It is centred around the circulation of armshells for necklaces and plays a crucial role in regulating alliances and circulation of goods between the islands. As institutionalised in the wider community network as it may be, the *kula* also remains “competitive enterprise wherein individuals act as free agents” ([Yan](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Yan2012) [2012](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Yan2012): 276).
- YES for *ceremonial exchange:* The *po’oa* is a traditional exchange ceremony among Eastern Tucanoan groups in the Vaupés (Northwestern Amazonia), which is carried out among intermarrying groups in order to celebrate a diverse range of rites of passages, such as puberty rites, marriage, naming. The ceremony is a gathering between different sib settlements, each of which is associated with a different language by virtue of patrilineal descent. The event is organised around various types of exchange, which also include highly conventionalised language exchanges, such as salutations, sung speeches or oratory ([Chernela](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Chernela2003) [2003](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Chernela2003)).

## Goal

These questions target different types of exogamic rules. All marriage systems have rules of exogamy, which specify the categories of individuals with whom marriage and sexual partnership are forbidden. Typically, exogamy rules are intertwined with incest taboos in that they universally forbid marriage between parents and children as well as between brothers and sisters. In addition to these basic exogamic categories, most societies extend marriage taboos to other close relatives (e.g. cousins). Exogamic rules that are broader in scope are also attested. In these cases, the outmarriage group is defined on the basis of the descent group, clan, moiety, or language group an individual belongs to.


## Definitions

Marriage systems around the world have rules and tendencies of exogamy, which specify the categories of individuals with whom marriage and sexual partnership are forbidden. Typically, exogamy rules are intertwined with incest taboos in that they universally forbid marriage between parents and children as well as between brothers and sisters. In addition to these basic exogamic categories, most societies extend marriage taboos to other close relatives (e.g. cousins). Exogamic rules that are broader in scope are also attested. In these cases, the outmarriage group is usually defined on the basis of the descent group, clan, moiety, or language group an individual belongs to.

The options listed in the question correspond to the following types of exogamic rules:

- *Village or other kind of local community*: A level of organisation that is closest to the household environment, but outside the realm of family and kin, e.g. village, neighbourhood, band. Marriage partners must come from different local communities/residential areas. Corresponds to phenomena such as ""village exogamy""
- *Descent group or clan*: Any emically defined ways of grouping people by shared ancestry and kin. Ideally a group larger than that of immediate family. The descent may be traced in anyway, e.g. patrilineally, matrilineally. Publications may refer to these groups variously as clans, kinship groups, descent groups, house systems, moiety. Corresponds to phenomena known as *descent group exogamy,clan exogamy*.
- *Designated marriage group such as a moiety*: A moiety is a group of individuals which coexists with another group and have complementary functions in the wider social context to which both groups belong. Moieties can for instance define the different groupings of people from which marriage patterns must come. For the purposes of this questionnaire, we are interested to know whether there are any such groups that determine marriageability pools.
- *Hierarchical social group such as class or caste*: Any group that is in a hierarchical relationship with one another.
- *Linguistic exogamy*: Marriage partners must come from different language groups, which may or may not be affinally related with each other (for instance, via cross-cousin marriage patterns). In communities practising linguistic exogamy, language identification is based on unilineal (patrilineal vs. matrilineal) descent.

## Examples

- *Descent group exogamy*: Marriage partners must come from different descent groups, which are defined patrilineally or matrilineally.
- *Clan exogamy*: Marriage partners must come from different clans. Clans can be defined as larger corporations of descent groups claiming common ancestry. The Sui people are a southwest Chinese community organised in several patrilineal clans each consisting of hundreds or thousands people claiming shared descent. Marriage is only permitted across clans. Sui women are expected to remain faithful to the dialectal features of their clan of descent. Loyalty to the patrilect equals loyal to the descent group ([Stanford](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Stanford2007) [2007](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Stanford2007); 2009b; 2010). This is an example of clan exogamy.
- *Moiety exogamy*: Marriage partners must come from different moieties. A moiety is a group of individuals which coexists with another group and have complementary functions in the wider social context to which both groups belong. Moieties can for instance define the different groupings of people from which marriage patterns must come. Shared descent is not a defining characteristic of moieties. The Canela community (South America) has four dual moiety configurations: one which is meant to regulate marriage across groups, and three others for ceremonial purposes. (The Editors [of Encyclopaedia Britannica](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:TheEditorsofEncyclopaediaBritannica2016) [2016b](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:TheEditorsofEncyclopaediaBritannica2016).) This is an example of moiety exogamy.
- *Linguistic exogamy*: Marriage partners must come from different language groups, which may or may not be affinally related with each other (for instance, via cross-cousin marriage patterns). In communities practicing linguistic exogamy, language identification is based on unilineal (patrilineal vs. matrilineal) descent. Eastern Tucanoan groups in Northwestern Amazonia practice linguistic exogamy with patrilineal descent: the individual’s ‘mother tongue’ is the father’s patrilect, while women who marry in speak a different patrilect ([Fleming](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Fleming2016) [2016](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Fleming2016)). This is an example of linguistic exogamy with patrilineal descent.
- *Village exogamy*: Marriage partners must come from different residential areas (e.g. different villages). Village exogamy is the norm among Munda populations of central India ([Sharma](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Sharma2004) [2004](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Sharma2004): 159).

## Theoretical & Empirical Support

Characterizing the rules of exogamy that regulate intermarriage between Focus Group and Neighbour Group helps us understanding population movements between the two groups, and their bearings on language contact. Since, in our research design, Focus Group and Neighbour Group are associated with different languages, rules of exogamy also play a role in determining which of the two languages has the potential of becoming the dominant language of communication between spouses and, ultimately, with their children. Exogamic rules thus contribute to informing systems of descents and patterns of language transmission both at the family level in the larger context of the speech community (cf. also [Lansing et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:LansingEtAl2017) [2017](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:LansingEtAl2017)).

By defining the range of people with whom marriage is forbidden, exogamic rules stipulate the directions towards which alliances between groups can be built through marriage, and contribute to enlarge the circle of contact from kin to wider social groups. ([Schwimmer](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Schwimmer1995) [1995–2003](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Schwimmer1995).)

Recent research shows that kinship structures may strongly influence the mapping between languages and population structures. Kinship structures are often defined through marriage patterns. [Lansing et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:LansingEtAl2017) ([2017](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:LansingEtAl2017)) find that postmarital residence patterns, which promote movements of individuals between speech communities, also lead to uniparental language transmission. More specifically, languages tend to be transmitted matrilineally in matrilocal societies and patrilineally in patrilocal societies. This is demonstrated by looking at the interaction between molecular anthropological data and data on language transmission. In matrilocal communities, language correlates with genetic similarities between individuals on the maternally inherited mtDNA, whereas in patrilocal communities, language correlates with genetic similarities between individuals on the paternally inherited Y chromosome. The study was based on comparisons of genetic and language phylogenies in 25 villages located on two Eastern Indonesian islands, Sumba and Timor. While Sumba villages are traditionally patrilocal, Timor is characterised by a more varied landscape of postmarital residence types: most villages are traditionally matrilocal, but pockets of patri- and ambi-locality are also found.

When marrying each other, should Focus Group people and Neighbour Group people marry somebody from:

- the same village or other kind of local community?
- the same descent group or clan?
- the same designated marriage group, such as a moiety?
- the same hierarchical social group such as class or caste?

Possible response:
- Yes
- No
## Goal

This question elicits different types of endogamic rules.


## Definitions

*Endogamic rules* specify with whom marriage is encouraged or prescribed.

The options listed in the question correspond to the following types of endogamic rules.

- *Village endogamy*: Marriage partners must come from the same village. Geographic boundaries are used to reinforce boundaries between social groups.
- *Descent group endogamy*: Marriage partners must come from the same descent group. This is typically done through parallel-cousin marriage, i.e. marriage between the offsprings of two brothers (in a patrilineal type of descent).
- *Caste endogamy*: Marriage partners must come from the same caste. These are hereditary social divisions by which such things as ownership, occupation, political position and ritual status are defined.
- *Class endogamy*: Marriage partners must come from the same socioeconomic class, a type of social stratification which is typically defined on the basis of wealth, occupation and/or level of education.
- *Linguistic endogamy*: Marriage partners must come from the same linguistic group (as defined emically)

## Examples

- *Village endogamy* patterns have been observed in rural Turkey. [Stirling](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Stirling1965) ([1965](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Stirling1965)) studied two rural Turkish villages, Elbasi and Sakaltutan, and noted a ratio of every two women marrying an resident of their natal village to every one who marries out. In both of these villages, the level of in-marriage among women residing in the village was over 60%. ([Stirling](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Stirling1965) [1965](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Stirling1965); [Schwimmer](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Schwimmer1995) [1995–2003](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Schwimmer1995).)
- *Descent group endogamy.* This pattern is common in Middle Eastern societies, both in contemporary Arab communities and in ancient Israel. The Old Testament describes parallel cousin marriage in many instances. ([Schwimmer](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Schwimmer1995) [1995–2003](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Schwimmer1995).)
- *Caste endogamy* is widespread in traditional Indian societies. The Nayar (East India) occupy a high rank in the local caste system. They marry within the caste or with higher castes, such as the Brahmins. They are however forbidden from marrying or engaging in sexual partnership with people from the lower ranking castes. ([Schwimmer](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Schwimmer1995) [1995–2003](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Schwimmer1995).)
- *Class endogamy* is quite widespread in contemporary Western societies. [Blackwell](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Blackwell1998) ([1998](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Blackwell1998)) analysed marriages in the United States and noticed a strong tendency for people two choose marriage partners with similar educational background. In addition to education, also religion affects marriage patterns in the United States ([Schwimmer](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Schwimmer1995) [1995–2003](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Schwimmer1995)).
- *Linguistic endogamy* has been documented in the Amazonian Vaupés region, where the Hup, Yuhup, and Kakua peoples mostly practice linguistic endogamy with clan exogamy ([Epps](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Epps2018) [2018](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Epps2018)).

## Theoretical & Empirical Support

Rules of endogamy contribute to define group identity, status, and power dynamics between neighbouring groups. They thus reinforce and define group boundaries through marriage exchange. Characterising the rules of endogamy that regulate intermarriage between Focus Group and Neighbour Group helps us the relationship between the two groups in terms of community identity. If marriage between individuals from the two groups is encouraged or prescribed as a means of reinforcing and perpetrating group identity, this likely means that, independently of the languages they speak, the two groups conceive of themselves as one (e.g. one descent group, one social group, one ethnicity, one area etc).

Possible response:
- Yes
- No
## Goal

This question identifies whether polygyny occurs in Focus Group society, or Neighbour Group society. The answers to this question should be about the overall pattern in society, and not restricted to marriages between Focus Group and Neighbour Group people. The answers to this question may help us further understand the nature of population movements between the two groups, and the general complexity of marriage dynamics.


## Definitions

*Polygyny*: the pattern of marriage whereby men can have more than one wife. It is a subset of polygamy, and is the most common form of polygamy world-wide.


## Examples

- All male members of the Dani community (Papua New Guinea) are allowed to have more than one wife from the moiety opposite to theirs, but access to marriage is age-graded in the sense that most men enter marriage after maturity, while women enter marriage in young age. Securing access to marriage through the life span guarantees high rates of multiple marriages among men. ([Schwimmer](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Schwimmer1995) [1995–2003](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Schwimmer1995); [Butt](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Butt2001) [2001](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Butt2001).) This would trigger the answer ""yes” to all three questions.
- In many traditional societies in southern Africa, access to multiple marriage reflected social stratification in the sense that commoners usually had only one wife, while chiefs, nobles, or other elite members of the society had several wives (Schwimmer 1993–2005; [Musisi](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Musisi1991) [1991](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Musisi1991); [Delius & Glaser](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:DeliusGlaser2004) [2004](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:DeliusGlaser2004)). In this context, appropriate answers to ""Is polygyny permissible for Focus Group men?"" and ""Is polygyny permissible for Neighbour Group men?"" would be ""yes"" if access to multiple marriage is shared by Focus and Neighbour Group, but the answer to ""Is polygyny permissible for men from all societal strata?"" would be ""no"".

## Theoretical & Empirical Support

Characterizing patterns of intermarriage between Focus Group and Neighbour Group in terms of whether polygyny is permissible, and for whom, allows us to better understand the nature of population movements between the two groups. Given that access to polygyny is often socially stratified (only a portion of the male population can afford several spouses), this can also count as an additional measure of opportunities of contact between Focus Group and Neighbour Group (this is under the assumption that polygamous men who marry across the two groups are more exposed to contact with the other group than individuals who don’t). In general, this question is also a way of getting a more fine-grained picture of marriage dynamics, which is often missing in discussions of contact.

Several explanations have been proposed to account for polygyny as a feature of marriage exchange. Among these, it has been suggested that polygyny occurs in situations of demographic imbalance between the two sexes, where women significantly outnumber men, for instance as a consequence of warfare. However, polygyny is also attested in societies where no such demographic imbalance exists between the sexes or, if it exists, it goes in the opposite direction (more men then women). In societies that practice polygyny, typically some men accumulate more spouses than others, because they are older and/or because they have have more means to sustain bridewealth requirements. In such contexts, polygyny becomes a way of defining social prestige and power dynamics in the male populations.

## Definitions

*Polyandry*, the marriage exchange pattern whereby women take more than one spouse, is the rarest form of polygamy worldwide. It is particularly common in the Himalayan regions of South Asia, but also attested in Africa, Oceania, and Native America.

- *Fraternal polyandry*: one woman is married to a group of brothers.
- *Non-fraternal polyandry:* a woman’s sexual partners and spouses are not related by kin.

## Examples

- *Fraternal polyandry*is common in the mountainous areas of Nepal and Tibet ([Berreman](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Berreman1962) [1962](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Berreman1962); 1978; [Goldstein](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Goldstein1971) [1971](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Goldstein1971); 1976) as among the Nyinba, where brothers live together with their shared spouse and children ([Levine](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Levine1988) [1988](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Levine1988)). Each child is recognised by one of the potential fathers, even when paternity is biologically unclear. This type of polygamous system has been explained as the result of demographic imbalance between men and women, due to women’s lower survival rates. It also has fundamental repercussions at the socio-economic level, in that it guarantees preservation of the joint estate, which is patrilineally transmitted. ([Berreman](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Berreman1978) [1978](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Berreman1978); 1980; [Willett](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Willett1997) [1997](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Willett1997))
- *Non-fraternal polyandry*: The Nayar are an upper caste group of Eastern India organised in small kingdoms with matrilineal descent and non-fraternal polyandry. Traditionally, no institutionalised type of marriage exchange existed in the community. When reaching puberty age, women could start entertaining sexual partnership with several men (usually up to eight), and would later be responsible for raising their children within the matrilineal household, where the only cohabiting adult males would be other members of the matrilineage (e.g. their brothers). Two ritual acts defined women’s polyandry as legitimate: the *tali*tying, through which a woman in puberty age would become connected to a young man from an allied lineage with the sole obligation of later mourning for his death together with her own children, and the midwife payment through which one of the lovers was expected to acknowledge the paternity of any of the children the woman would bear. ([Gough](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Gough1952) [1952](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Gough1952); 1959; 1965)

## Note

Since polyandry is not possible in any of the investigated groups, the questions on what types of polyandry are possible have been removed.

What type of marriage payments and transfers are expected when Focus Group and Neighbour Group marry?

- Bridewealth
- Dowry
- Other


## Goal

Understanding the nature of marriage-related payments and transfers between Focus and Neighbour Group may give us a sense of any power imbalances between the two groups in terms of circulation and accumulation of wealth. The question thus allows us to capture the general complexity of marriage dynamics.


## Definitions

In most societies, marriage has a big impact on the economy of intermarrying groups. The terms of marriage exchanges contribute to regulate the distribution of property and wealth, and they thus often involve compensatory practices of transfers and payments. These may function as a way of compensating for the displacement of individuals from their groups of origin in to the in-marrying groups, or as a form of support to the newly formed social unit that the marriage exchange creates.

- *Bride price*: The payment/tribute is made by the groom or his family to the bride’s family.
- *Dowry*: A donation of money/household goods that the bride’s parents make to the new family nucleus established by their daughter and her husband. The payment/transfer is usually inherited by the children that the couple may have.
- *Other*: Such as Groom Price (the inverse of Bride Price); bride service (the new husband is required to work for his father-in-law for some time, as a means of compensating for the rights he acquired on his spouse through marriage).

## Examples

- In southern African societies (e.g. the Zulu), the bride wealth (traditionally called *lobola*) consists of cattle transferring from the groom or the groom’s family to the bride’s father or brother. The payment must be returned in case the marriage does not bear any children and the woman is divorced. If the marriage relationship is ‘successful’, the father can use the cattle to provide wives for his sons, who are in turn expected to return the payment once their first daughter is married. The *lobola* thus establishes debt and a cyclical system of transactions between the parties involved. This is an example of bride price.
- *Dowry*: The practice of dowry was very common in Europe until the 19th century and is still observed in some traditional societies within Europe (e.g. some form of dowry is still practiced in many villages in Sicily, personal knowledge).
- *Other, Groom Price*: Groom Price is common in some East Indian cultures; bride service is documented in the Bible.

## Goal

The goal of this question is to identify whether the family and co-residential unit are the same for the majority of the time over the course of a marriage. All societies appear to have different residential arrangements depending on the life stage of an individual (what in anthropological parlance is called *the development cycle*). We are interested in the degree of overlap between family and co-residential unit insofar as it has some kind of impact on language use and learning.


## Examples

- YES for *mothers (and their children) who live with their husbands as part of a co-residential unit*: Described as “nuclear family” or “conjugal unit”, e.g. nomad tents in parts of Kham, Tibet ([Thargyal](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Thargyal2007) [2007](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Thargyal2007)).
- YES for *mothers(and their children) live with their mothers:* Where both the husband and wife continue to reside with their families of origin even after marriage. Children usually reside with the mother. Described as natalocal residence in anthropological parlance, e.g. the Nayar of western Senegal ([Gough](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Gough1959a) [1959](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Gough1959a)), or the Akan of Ghana/Ivory Coast.
- YES for *mothers (and their children) live with their mother-in-laws:* Extended kin or other adults may also be living with the mother, husband, and children, such as Dayak long houses in Malaysia ([Harrison](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Harrison1976) [1976](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Harrison1976); [Helliwell](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Helliwell1992) [1992](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Helliwell1992)), and the Balkan *zadruga*. Families residing in separated private dwelling within a larger co-residential units fall in this category, e.g. Huave house-lots (ndén) in Mexico ([Diebold](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Diebold1966) [1966](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Diebold1966)).

## Theoretical & Empirical Support

Knowing whether a woman, her child, and the father of the child are cohabiting is important for two reasons. 1) Because we want to get a sense of how much opportunity a Focus Group person has to learn and use the Neighbour Group language from their Neighbour Group spouse, and 2) we want to get a sense of how much opportunity a Focus Group child has to learn and use the Neighbour Group language from their Neighbour Group parent.

Anthropological works show very clearly that a family is not necessarily the same as a daily co-residential unit. Research on child bilingual acquisition in interlingual households have found that the amount of input of a language heavily affects the likelihood of successful language transmission; especially if one of the parental languages is a minority language ([Yamamoto](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Yamamoto2001) [2001](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Yamamoto2001), [De Houwer](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:DeHouwer2007) [2007](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:DeHouwer2007)). Given this, we would want to know whether families do indeed spend much of their daily life together or not. If a family and co-residential unit do not overlap, we may surmise that there is less language learning and socialisation opportunities compared to a group where family and co-residential units do indeed overlap.

The answer to this question is treated as one of a number of factors that play a role in affecting the outcomes of language change. The factor by itself is likely unable to affect outcomes, but in combination with other factors, is thought to play a role.

The most influential form of knowledge in this contact scenario is:

- Global
- Local


## Goal

This question intends to identify some cursory characterisation about the most influential form of knowledge in the contact scenario. The major distinction is whether that knowledge is part of a larger and shared community of practice beyond the immediate area, or whether it is not.


## Definitions

- *Global*: The knowledge is shared by people outside the region, and is shared in relatively distant areas. Bearers of this knowledge should have such an awareness, and an awareness as practitioners of a larger community of practice
- *Local*: contrast against “global knowledge”. Local knowledge is unique to the area or region, shared by people in a comparatively local area (e.g. shamanic practices). Components of the practice or belief system may have its origins from other regions, but bearers of this knowledge understand the knowledge to be localised.

## Examples

- *Global*: world religions, Arabic numeral mathematics, Chinese medicinal practices
- *Local*: Historical practices of shamanism as discernable from historical texts. Northern shamanism, defined as a “worldview system” with associated beliefs, practices, and paraphenelia ([Pentikäinen](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Pentikainen1996) [1996](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Pentikainen1996): 10), is found across the arctic and subarctic parts of the world. But northern shamanism manifests in different ways in different parts of the north, and touches on “ecology, economy, social structure” etc. For example, Manchu-Tungusic peoples of north East-Asia have both a concept and a word for shaman, while the Khanty (Russia) have similar phenomena but no word or concept to bind it in a similar way (ibid.). In other words, while shamanism as a phenomena can be characterised at a macro-areal level with many parallels, we would characterise it as predominantly a local phenomena grounded in the environments and lives of particular groups.

## Theoretical & Empirical Support

This question reflects the skew in publications concerning language and education: namely that the religions and education systems being researched are associated with expansionist phenomena such as colonisation. Thus many case studies and claims about language change and religion focus overwhelmingly on Eurasian world religions, noticeably of Christianity (summary by Spolsky in [Omoniyi et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:OmoniyiEtAl2006) [2006](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:OmoniyiEtAl2006)). Case studies on education, and language policy studies, also appear to be in the context of superseding localised forms of knowledge and communication; often with a colonial or nationalising agenda (for a summary, see [Spolsky & Lambert](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:SpolskyLambert2006) [2006](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:SpolskyLambert2006)). The aim of this question is to identify whether the influential form of knowledge in the contact scenario may fit these kinds of scenarios. In other words, we are using ""global"" and ""local"" as proxy labels for ""knowledge system of large and areally diffused group"" and ""local"" for ""knowledge system of small and geographically localised group"".

At the stage of writing, we as a project are not familiar with what language change phenomena are attributed to the practices of localised forms of knowledge. The only forms that come to mind are investigations of lexicon of specialised domains such as ethnobotanical knowledge, often in the context of cultural endangerment (e.g. [Carlson](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Carlson2001) [2001](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Carlson2001)). In cases where knowledge systems of larger groups brush up against knowledge systems of localised groups, it seems that there is a threat of localised knowledge being lost (however there are also cases of precarious but successful intergenerational transmission, e.g. ethnobotanical knowledge of Ngunnuwal and Yuin people of Australia ([Heaney et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:HeaneyEtAl2020) [2020](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:HeaneyEtAl2020)).

How commonly are Focus Group and Neighbour Group people involved in public modes of production? How commonly are Focus Group and Neighbour Group people involved in public modes of production?

- Very commonly
- Commonly
- Somewhat commonly
- Uncommonly
- Very uncommonly

## Goal

In this question we wish to know whether economic activity can be characterised as leaning towards subsistence, or towards large-scale wealth generation. These in turn may tell us something about interactional norms among the people who work in these different modes.


## Definitions and Examples

- *Public mode of production:* where there is a split between the public and private domains, and the individual goes out to the public domain to sell his/her labour. The work does not directly benefit the worker.
- *Domestic mode of production*: work activity, production, and consumption all occur at the household, family, or local community level. This mode of labour is often characterised as “free” under Western economic orthodoxy.
Note that ""people"" may include children in some contact situations.

The scale used is as follows:

- *Very commonly*: Work surrounding public modes of production is common enough for the majority of adults. Public modes of work are unremarked upon, is an experience shared by a majority of people. This is the widespread norm in e.g. contemporary WEIRD societies where the majority of adults are involved in salaried work.
- *Commonly*: Work surrounding public modes of production is common enough that it is not remarked upon much, but maybe limited to certain subsets of the population (e.g. only men work).
- *Somewhat commonly*: Work surrounding public modes of production is uncommon, and is an experience that is restricted to a minority of the population.
- *Uncommonly*: Work surrounding public modes of production is very rare, such that it is remarked upon. For example, in modern-day southern New Guinea, a handful of adults are salaried teachers but the vast majority of adults do not receive a salary of any kind and are subsistence horticulturalists.
- *Very uncommonly*: There is no work surrounding public modes of production.

## Theoretical & Empirical Support

Workplaces of the public mode of labour are often stratified, which tends to result in differential linguistic behaviour and variation in linguistic forms among workers (e.g. [Leach](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Leach2018) [2018](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Leach2018) on industrial vs managerial workers in the pottery industry in the UK). Collective work in factories that pull people from other parts of the world report cases where workers are not necessarily able to communicate with the employer or with their colleagues (e.g. [Premji et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:PremjiEtAl2008) [2008](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:PremjiEtAl2008) on a factory in Montreal, Canada). In such multilingual settings, it tends to be that many workers have more frequent contact with those who shared a first language other than that of the majority or with speakers with very different styles and varieties of this majority language (e.g. [Goldstein](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Goldstein1997) [1997](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Goldstein1997); [Clyne](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Clyne1994) [1994](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Clyne1994) on Melbourne, Australia; and [Duff et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:DuffEtAl2000) [2000](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:DuffEtAl2000) on Canada). While we have not investigated it specifically, research into ways of speaking and interaction in private modes of labour likely exist but in small quantities.

Macro studies which investigate language change and diversity sometimes include subsistence patterns and economies of production (e.g. [Derungs et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:DerungsEtAl2018) [2018](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:DerungsEtAl2018)), and this is done for seemingly two related reasons. One reason is that there is a tacit understanding by linguists that groups will organise themselves differently according to the needs of differing modes of production, which then have consequences for social structure, behaviour, and linguistic interaction (e.g. [Epps](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Epps2017) [2017](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Epps2017)). The idea that, for example, peoples of rice-growing societies, wheat-growing societies, and hunter-gatherer societies have behaviour patterns that differ from one another is a relatively old observation ([Berry](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Berry1967) [1967](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Berry1967)). Another reason why subsistence is thought to have consequences is that different patterns of subsistence might overlap with environmental productivity and other geographical and climatic factors that affect peoples' behaviours and social structures (the relationship between geographical-climatic factors and languages is, however, not straight forward, see [Collard & Foley](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:CollardFoley2002) [2002](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:CollardFoley2002); [Gavin & Sibanda](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:GavinSibanda2012) [2012](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:GavinSibanda2012); [Coelho et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:CoelhoEtAl2019) [2019](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:CoelhoEtAl2019)).This falls under the Ecological Risk Hypothesis ([Nettle](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Nettle1999) [1999](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Nettle1999)).

Focus Group people are the most likely to speak in an unmonitored way in:

- Nuclear family
- Band
- Neighbourhood or village
- Town or city
- Other

## Goal

Members of a local community may come to interact in several different spaces and situations. Having an understanding of what these spaces/domains of interaction are, and of which of them are associated with unmonitored speech registers, will give us a hint of the potential for contact between Focus and Neighbour Group.


## Definitions

- *Local Community*: Domain concerning the surroundings closes to the household environment, but outside the realm of family and kin. A space of interaction that may extend beyond a bounded geographical place (this is done in order to capture mobile groups (e.g. nomads) and other communities of practice).
- *Unmonitored speech:* Ways of speaking where speakers are paying less attention to the forms they produce, compared to situations where they do (such as formal situations). Overlaps somewhat with notions of ""vernacular speech"".

The possible answer options are as follows:

- *Nuclear Family*: Minimally, a unit of mother and child, or some culturally specific equivalent.
- *Band*: A collection of families that are connected by some culturally meaningful relational bond that is not geographically defined (e.g. descent, marriage, friendship, other).
- *Neighbourhood or village*: A collection of people who are primarily, though not always, defined as being of a particular geographic location (a Navajo camp which migrates seasonally is a non-geographical example). Neighbourhood and villages tend to be numerically small, roughly between 60 to 350~500 people. The numerical range is more of a guideline; if a neighbourhood is part of a larger city, we may expect a larger number of people (i.e. a suburb in New York). Choose this option if this is the case, rather than choosing town or city.
- *Town or city*:  Larger in terms of population and geographic spread than a neighbourhood or village. We assume that members of this unit do not know each other personally.
- *Other*: For example, vernaculars that are based on social categories such as race, ethnicity, religious denomination, clan, sexuality,  if these social groupings are geographically dispersed, and do not cluster/live closely to one another in places such as neighbourhoods and villages.

## Examples

- *Nuclear Family*: An example of society where the space of the local community largely coincides with the family/household are traditional reindeer pastoralist cultures who typically followed their herds throughout the year ([Vorren](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Vorren1978) [1978](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Vorren1978); [Næss et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:NaessEtAl2010) [2010](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:NaessEtAl2010): 248). In such contexts, the space of use of unmonitored speech in the local community would coincide with the nuclear family.Choose “The nuclear family” if the groups you are answering for spend most of their daily time in the family/household environment, but may meet up with other groups during special occasions. (cf. wiki for examples from the ethnographic literature)
- *Town or city*: In Kupwar, of the Sangli district India, in the 1960s, the “neutral village language” is described as Marathi ([Kulkarni-Joshi](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Kulkarni-Joshi2016) [2016](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Kulkarni-Joshi2016): 149; [Gumperz & Wilson](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:GumperzWilson1971) [1971](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:GumperzWilson1971)), while different ethnic-religious-caste groups have their own home language. In this case, the Kupwar town-village would be the largest unit of the local community, and Marathi the language of this largest unit.
- *Other:*An example of what may count as ‘other’ in the proposed list of answer types would be those groups analysed under the community of practice model, such as being a jock/burn out ([Eckert](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Eckert1989) [1989](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Eckert1989)), or identifying with one’s sexual orientation ([Munson](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Munson2007) [2007](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Munson2007)). For most pre-modern communities, however, we assume this option is unlikely, and that most groups will have formed communities in geographic space.
- Choose “other” only if the community of practice associated with the use of unmonitored speech cannot be identified with any of the other interactional spaces listed above.

## Theoretical & Empirical Support

*On the importance of location*

We have chosen to identify the location of the local community both in terms of geographically situated units (i.e. neighbourhood, village), and those that are not (i.e. band). This is a reflection of a historical trend in modern linguistics to contrast agricultural vs non-agricultural language communities, which subsumes sedentary vs mobile societies, as well as small vs large populations (cf. [Bowern](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Bowern2010) [2010](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Bowern2010)). While there is great variability and diversity of configurations within the categories we have chosen, the intention of this question is to give a rough approximation of group size and mobility on a global level. Physical environments and geography undoubtedly play a role in both patterns of language variation, and diffusion of linguistic innovations (cf. [Johnstone](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Johnstone2010) [2010](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Johnstone2010)). In pre-modern communities, being geographically situated was a major factor that shaped peoples lives, so using physical-spatial/geographic units to capture some sense of local community seems justified. Language varieties which can be ascribed to the realm of ‘unmonitored speech’/‘informal registers’ may of course be used in group based on race and religion which do not presuppose a geographically bounded location. Such communities, however, still tend to be clustered into neighbourhoods and other physically proximate spaces (e.g. as shown in [Labov et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:LabovEtAl2006) [2006](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:LabovEtAl2006) in the *Atlas of North American English*).

The number of people used to characterise the options are based on [Dunbar](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Dunbar1993) ([1993](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Dunbar1993)). Our “band” corresponds roughly to his “over-night camp”, our “neighbourhood or village” roughly corresponding to his “band/village”.

*On the importance of unmonitored speech*

Monitored vs unmonitored was chosen as an axis of importance because sociolinguistic theories inspired by Labovian variationist research identify the latter as the the locus where entrenchment of linguistic innovations occur ([Labov](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Labov1972a) [1972](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Labov1972a); cf. [Poplack & Tagliamonte](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:PoplackTagliamonte1999) [1999](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:PoplackTagliamonte1999)). The notion of “vernacular speech” is partially related with the amount of attention speakers pay to their speech in different communicative situations. Vernacular speech is typically used when communicating with intimates in familiar contexts ([Labov](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Labov1972a) [1972](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Labov1972a): 208). Evidence of linguistic innovations in unmonitored speech are then taken as a sign of diffusion through the community, and an entrenchment of the innovation in speakers’ repertoires.

There are other terms used in linguistics that fall under this notion of monitored vs unmonitored speech. Formal registers, for example, can be defined as speech styles that involve maximal attention to speech. They are typically used when communicating with non-intimates in non-familiar, highly codified contexts. Informal registers on the other hand are speech styles that correlate with minimal attention to speech and are typically used when communicating with intimates in familiar contexts.

Traded good types. Which of the following do Focus Group and Neighbour Group trade with each other?

- Raw materials and primary produce
- Luxury items
- Manufactured goods

## Goal

This question tries to capture the nature of the trade relationship between Focus and Neighbour Group by focusing on the types of goods that are being exchanged and the direction of the exchange.


## Definitions

- *Raw materials and primary produce*: wood, minerals, rice, wheat
- *Luxuries*: objects primarily of status and/or enjoyment (items of beautification, books, prestige food stuffs)
- *Manufactured goods*: paper, machines, craft goods, tools. Excludes luxuries.

## Theoretical & Empirical Support
This question tries to capture whether there are any asymmetries in trade relations between the Focus and Neighbours groups. This question is thus more broadly related to the issue of power relations between the two groups and languages.

The rationale for studying asymmetries in power between Focus and Neighbour groups is based on the analysis that language shift (wholesale or piecemeal) occurs because speakers are either forced to shift or perceive a benefit in shifting towards the language of the more powerful group. Power in this instance is linked to the areas of trade and labour, i.e. socio-economic opportunity. [Benrabah](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Benrabah2014) ([2014](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Benrabah2014)) summarises various measures of a language's power used by a range of researchers, and notable is the recurrent identification of some parameter of economic power (e.g. [Ammon](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Ammon2003) [2003](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Ammon2003); [Mackey](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Mackey1973) [1973](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Mackey1973), 1976; Fishman 1977; [Laponce](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Laponce1987) [1987](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Laponce1987); [Weber](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Weber1999) [1999](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Weber1999)).

D3,D3: Does involvement in domain X differ based on social categories?,"# [](ContributionTable?__template__=property.md&property=name#cldf:D3)

Authors: [](ContributionTable?__template__=property.md&property=contributor#cldf:D3)
The answer is a binary ""yes"" vs ""no"" for each of the following nine social categories:

- Hierarchies associated to profession or wealth, such as a person's class or caste
- Magico-religiously sanctioned group, such as religious denomination
- Descent group, such as clan, house, lineage group, kinship group
- Group of land ownership, such as tribe, clan, territorial group
- Race, ethnicity, or some other similar grouping
- Age or life stage
- A person’s place identity and affiliation
- Sex or gender
- Any other communities of practice
## Goal

This question seeks to identify social categories that likely form distinct communities of practice within the larger societal context. Put another way, we are interested in identifying emically relevant social groups which may play a role in domain-internal linguistic variation. We use the term ""communities of practice"" to broadly refer to a group of people connected to one another by partaking in similar activities and/or states of being. By doing so we acknowledge the socially constructed and culturally specific nature of social categories such as gender, ethnicity, as well as acknowledging that these social categories are social practices.

We are interested in the existence of these salient social categories for a few reasons. Firstly, identifying emically relevant social categories gives us a chance to identify possible subnetworks of people within a speech community and domain. Contact situations would affect subnetworks differently, in that a single speech community experiences contact heterogeneously. For example, contact between Finnish speakers and speakers of L1 varieties of English in the domain of work is likely to be concentrated towards white-collar and other upper-middle socio-economic networks, while contact between Finnish speakers and Kurdish speakers would cover a different demographic. The complexity of social networks in any given contact situation means that there are various pathways through which linguistic innovations can diffuse (or not) through the wider speech community. Emically salient social categories often seem to be good candidates for identifying the social patterning of linguistic variation within a community. By identifying possible sub-networks, we may get a better picture of how linguistic consequences of contact may or may not diffuse through to the wider speech community.

Ideally we would want respondents to identify those social categories that are known or thought to affect linguistic production in the Focus Group (i.e. socially condition linguistic variation). However since it is unlikely that such data are available for many communities, we are going to make an evidence-based assumption that the mere emic identification of social categories makes it likely that linguistic variation and differentiation may occur along these lines. Thus we have *a priori* chosen the social categories in the possible responses with the understanding that these social categories have been found to relate to linguistic variation in various communities around the world.

## Definitions

_Hierarchy associated with profession and wealth such as class and caste:_ The key criteria here are “hierarchy” and “associated with profession”. If this social category is also magico-religiously sanctioned, choose “yes” for the “magico-religiously sanctioned group such as caste and religious denomination”. Examples include feudal European divisions such as nobility and serf.

_Magico-religiously sanctioned group such as caste and religious denomination:_ A group whose existence and powers are justified based on spiritual/divine/non-human foundations (e.g. the clergy, Hindu caste system, ceremonial groups) and/or creed (e.g. Sunni & Shia muslims). Choose “yes” for groups that can be described as a “denomination of a religion”. If this social category overlaps with certain professions, choose “yes” also for the “Class, caste, other hierarchy group”.

_Relationships of descent:_ A group based on emically defined ways of grouping people who share ancestry and kin. Publications may refer to these groups variously as clans, kinship groups, descent groups, house systems. For moieties and similar systems, put “yes” in “Other.”

_Group of land ownership:_ A social category that, to the best of your knowledge, is primarily concerned with rights and claims of ownership and usage of territory. Membership to this social category should have some “hereditary” or “familial” requirement, so would not include purely mercantile entities. Choose “yes” if there are emically recognised names for such groups. Publications may refer to these groups variously as clans, tribes.

_Race, ethnicity, or some other kind of grouping:_ A difference based on perceived physical differences, often overlapping with perceived cultural and linguistic differences. Choose “yes” only if emic commentary on this category mentions perceived physical differences along with identification of difference in one of the following: economic system, wealth, primary subsistence pattern, major staple crop, belief system.

_Age cohort, life stage:_ A social category that is related to life stages, such as pre-initate, teenage-hood, unmarried, community elder. We are not asking if there is evidence of age-conditioned variation (i.e. a change in progress), but if there are emically salient age cohorts, which arguably form some kind of CoP.

_Place identity and affiliation:_ A type of identity that is constructed on the basis of specific places and areas. Examples of places include: places of residence such as village or neighbourhood, notions of city-folk vs farming-folk, notions of a mother country or origin place, regional identities such as Bavarian in Germany or Mid-Western American.

_Other:_ Other Communities of Practice than those listed above. For example: Moieties, cohort groups that do not fit any of the above categories, gangs, political parties, mercantile groups, clubs. Please name the Communities of Practice of relevance in the comment section.

_Sex or gender:_ Choose “yes” only if one’s assigned gender severely restricts the experience within the domain. For example, if women are excluded from participation in this domain, choose “yes”.
## Examples

*Sex*: What qualifies as ""Yes"" in this context are more extreme situations in which the possibilities of linguistic interaction between the sexes in a given social domain are highly constrained from the perspective of sociocultural practices and conceptualisations thereof. For instance, in traditional Muslim societies, possibilities of interaction between men and women across social domains are shaped by the practice of classifying people of the opposite sex as those with whom marriage is forbidden (*mahram*, e.g. a woman's father and brother) and those with whom marriage is permitted (*na-mahram*). Social and linguistic interactions with the latter group are highly constrained by this distinction across all social domains (e.g. in trade or in the neighbourhood space): ""Places, both at home and in the neighbourhood, where one is likely to encounter, meet, and interact with *na-mahram* people become defined as restricted spaces for both women and men"" ([Mazumdar & Mazumdar](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:MazumdarMazumdar2001) [2001](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:MazumdarMazumdar2001): 304).

For example, [in many societies women were excluded from receiving formal education / the types of work that people are involved in differ, depending on their caste/ people of differing social classes hang around in different social circles centred around different activities]. In order to qualify for a ""yes"" answer, the social category group should be emically significant enough to potentially have some linguistic consequences, even if it is limited solely to the people of that group (e.g. monks have their own extensively used lect, which has little linguistic effect on the wider community).

We would say for contemporary urban examples such as London, the social categories of ""class"", and ""race/ethnicity"", affect a person's experience of commerce in the city. That is, the types of commerce opportunities and situations that an upper-class person engages in would be different to that of a lower-class person; the commerce opportunities and situations are different for Anglo-British, and peoples of East Asian, South Asian, and Caribbean heritage.

Is it typical for Focus Group men to marry Neighbour Group women?
- Yes
- No
Is it typical for Focus Group women to marry Neighbour Group men?
- Yes
- No


## Goal

Here we ask whether intermarriage between Focus Group and Neighbour Group involves movement of people from both sexes (Focus Group men and women as well as Neighbour Group men and women) and in both directions (i.e. from and to Focus Group and from and to Neighbour Group). It is a way of getting a sense of the internal composition of the contact network between Focus Group and Neighbour Group in the context of marriage.


## Examples

- Marriage exchange between Bantu, agriculturalist, and 'Khoisan', hunter-gatherer, communities in southern Africa was historically highly sex-biased in the sense that Khoisan women would marry in Bantu communities, but not the other way round (Bantu women marrying in Khoisan communities, see [Pakendorf et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:PakendorfEtAl2011) [2011](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:PakendorfEtAl2011): 70). These situations would yield a ""Yes"" answer for ""It is typical for Focus Group men to marry Neighbour Group women?"" and ""No"" answer for ""Is it typical for Focus Group women to marry Neighbour Group men?"".
- Reciprocal spouse exchange is often found between intermarrying sib settlements with patrilineal and patrilocal descent. In such cases, for any group A woman who marries a group B man, a marriage between a group B woman and a group A man is expected in return. This type of reciprocal spouse exchange is for instance common in Aboriginal Australian societies. (The Editors [of Encyclopaedia Britannica](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:TheEditorsofEncyclopaediaBritannica2016) [2016a](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:TheEditorsofEncyclopaediaBritannica2016).) In this case, the answer for both ""It is typical for Focus Group men to marry Neighbour Group women?"" and ""Is it typical for Focus Group women to marry Neighbour Group men?"" would be ""Yes"".

## Theoretical & Empirical Support

Linguistic transmission in multilingual settings can be affected by the direction of marriage exchange. This is because marriage exchanges play a fundamental role in establishing systems of descent and shaping the kin systems of the intermarrying groups. Marriage exchange create the very context for population movements across groups and they also contribute to shape the population structures of the respective groups. The direction of marriage exchange is also connected with post-marital residence rules, which regulate where the married couple establishes its place of residence after marriage. For a recent study on the relationship between intermarriage practices in multilingual settings (viewed from the perspective of postmarital residence rules) and its consequences for language transmission, see [Lansing et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:LansingEtAl2017) ([2017](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:LansingEtAl2017)).

The relationship between Focus Group and Neighbour Group in the domain of knowledge can typically be characterised as:

- Focus Group people are masters,  Neighbour Group are novices
- Neighbour Group people are masters, Focus Group are novices
- None of the above

## Goal

In this question we wish to identify whether Focus Group people tend to occupy a position of authority in terms of knowledge transmission. Here we are concerned with the status of recognised knowledge bearer, rather than the exact nature of the knowledge (e.g. religious knowledge, magic and sorcery, histories etc.)


## Definitions

- *Masters*: knowledge bearers, teachers, instructors etc.
- *Novice*: recipient of knowledge, student, apprentice, congregation members, etc.

## Examples

- *None of the above*: For example, situations where Focus Group and Neighbour Group are equally likely to be in master or novice positions
- None of the above: For example, situations where both Focus Group and Neighbour Group tend to be novices, and masters are from another group.


## Theoretical & Empirical Support

The main rationale for this question is based on the following understanding: when a group of people tend to be recognised as masters and bearers of knowledge, these people and their symbols are likely to be associated with authority. This authority has consequences for linguistic behaviour.

Clear instances can be seen of the power associated with masters of knowledge, in relation to language standardisation in the nation state. Specifically, a lot of research has been conducted in the realm of language management and a myriad of consequences from such policies (cf. [Spolsky & Lambert](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:SpolskyLambert2006) [2006](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:SpolskyLambert2006)). In general, teachers appear to believe that language management is possible. Formal education, whether it be language instruction or other parts of the curriculum, enforces the use of a standard. This has often resulted in the reduced prestige of other languages and varieties; most acutely visible in colonial contexts (e.g. [Givón](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Givon1971) [1971](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Givon1971) for Africa)

Related to this notion of power and influence, it appears that standardised language, and religious language, are highly monitored for linguistic deviations. Writing about sacred languages in general, [Fudge](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Fudge2006) ([2006](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Fudge2006): 526) notes that priests who are charged with conducting worship and ceremonial events often need to learn archaic phonological forms of a language. In nationalistic contexts with standardised varieties, there are often accompanying purist beliefs that have strong ideological oppositions to use of foreign languages ([Kroskrity](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Kroskrity1998) [1998](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Kroskrity1998)). While this question is not specifically looking at notions of language purity, the likelihood that such ideologies increase if a group of people tend to be held up as authorities in the realm of knowledge. Correspondingly, if a group tends to occupy the position of novice, we may assume their authority is low (or non-existent).

Is there hierarchy involved in work?
## Answer Options

Binary
- Yes
- No
## Goal

The aim of this question is to identify whether there are any formally recognised hierarchical relationships particular to the organisation of work in the contact situation at stake.
## Definitions

By _formally recognised_, we mean hierarchical positions within work which are named (see examples below).
## Examples

- _Yes_: Managers & subordinates
- Yes: Land owning Janins (Kannada-speakers) and Muslims and Hindus (Urdu-speakers) working the lands. ([Gumperz & Wilson](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:GumperzWilson1971) [1971](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:GumperzWilson1971))
## Theoretical & Empirical Support

The rationale for this question is grounded in the understanding that different communities of practice, and especially those associated with differences in power, can results in speech styles and practices that are unique to those contexts.  Knowing something about work hierarchy involving the groups in contact provides extra insight into the dynamics of ""socio-economic power"" which is thought to be highly significant in language contact situations (e.g. by [Thomason and Kaufman](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:ThomasonKaufman1988) [1988](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:ThomasonKaufman1988); [Yakpo](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Yakpo2020) [2020](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Yakpo2020)).

Being in positions of authority at work may lead to differential speech styles when compared to people in authoritative positions. A study of Tokyo Japanese natural speech found that being in positions of authority had consequences for the kinds of linguistic constructions favoured in production. Both men and women in positions of authority at work favored full-forms of predicates, in contrast to home-maker women who preferred fragmental and elided utterances ([Takano](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Takano2000) [2000](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Takano2000); 2001). The analysis presented is that this is difference is due to the relatively wider and heterogeneous communication networks of the workers in leadership positions, who are required to speak directly. The uses of utterance-final forms by working women and men in non-authoritative positions were found to be somewhere in between workers in positions of authority, and the homemakers.

Hierarchy in profession intersects with other societal variables, so we would not expect hierarchy in work alone to hold explanatory power over language variation. In Kupwar India profession, caste, and religion are highly correlated, so it is not hierarchy at work per se that is affecting language choice but the symbolic relationship between these combined factors. Urdu-speaking Muslims and Hindu “low” castes workers who worked in the farms owned by Kannada-speaking Jains are all said to have spoken Urdu, Kannada, and Marathi the neutral village language ([Gumperz & Wilson](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:GumperzWilson1971) [1971](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:GumperzWilson1971)), and [Kulkarni-Joshi](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Kulkarni-Joshi2015) ([2015](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Kulkarni-Joshi2015)) notes a local variety of Kannada was spoken by the Muslims and Hindus. The analyses by Guperz, Wilson, and Kulkarni-Joshi is that religious identity and the private sphere primarily informed language choice in Kupwar in he 1950s and 60s, with profession and work being highly correlated with religion and caste.

## Answer Options

- Use money
- Exchange objects
- This is contextual
## Goal

The aim of this question is to find out whether money is used in trade, or not.
## Definitions

For the purposes of this question, money is understood as a standardised system of exchange regulated by some centralised group with authority (typically a state), and employs tokens to represent the value of goods and services. Coinage is the prototypical form of money.

Barter is defined as ""a complementary exchange in which each participant bargains until he or she is satisfied"" (following Humphrey 1985:49)
## Examples

Given that there are no known societies that rely purely on barter ([Humphrey](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Humphrey1985) [1985](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Humphrey1985)) or money, we ask respondents to consider the typicality of money/object exchange in the acquisition of goods and services between the Focus and Neighbour groups.

- A group that typically makes payments without negotiation of price should be considered ""use money"".
- A group that typically barters, and uses cash as a means of bargaining, will be considered ""exchange objects"".
- This is contextual: Any group that has a strong mix of the above two modes.
## Theoretical & Empirical Support

The use of money, and monetary systems for trade, tell us a few things.
The wide-spread use of currency suggests that a group participates in a system of payment where the value of money is defined, guaranteed, and accepted by some centralised authority ([Orrell & Chlupatý](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:OrrellChlupaty2016) [2016](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:OrrellChlupaty2016): 21). The mode of payment may be coinage, or a state-backed system of credit.

The use of currencies vs barter as a primary means may suggest certain kinds of interactions and linguistic exchanges. Experimental evidence suggests that the use of cash results in more solitary and individualistic behaviours ([Vohs et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:VohsEtAl2006) [2006](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:VohsEtAl2006)), which may in turn have consequences for interactions and linguistic norms. Unlike the use of cash which raises the possibility of interaction between strangers, barter tends to take place between people who know one another ([Humphrey](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Humphrey1985) [1985](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Humphrey1985)). Although barter almost always co-exists alongside the use of money ([Humphrey & Hugh-Jones](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Humphrey_Hugh-Jones_1992) [1992](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Humphrey_Hugh-Jones_1992), [Davies](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Davies2002) [2002](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Davies2002): 11–13), if a group mostly barters, this type of exchange probably involves intimates, and a higher degree of linguistic interaction associated with the notion of a society of intimates ([Givón & Young](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:GivonYoung2002) [2002](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:GivonYoung2002), [Trudgill](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Trudgill2011) [2011](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Trudgill2011)).

Where do Focus Group and Neighbour Group people typically interact together?

- At places which belong to the Focus Group
- At places which belong to the Neighbour Group
- At places which belong to some other group
- This is highly contextual
## Goal

The intention of this question is to capture whether there are any social groups associated with the geographic locations and physical places where domain activity is conducted.


## Definitions

The word “belong” in the question is intentionally under-defined so that the respondent may understand it in a way that makes sense for the community in question. If this wording is still too strong, another way to consider the question is “what social group is associated with the location where interaction typically occurs?”.

We are interested in the largest possible conceptualisation of place. We are less interested in whether individual spaces or places are owned by people of one or another group. We wish to know whether these spaces are situated within larger tracts of space and land that are associated with some group or another.

- *This is highly contextual*: Choose this response if locations are dependent on some other considerations, and it is difficult to generalise. For example: work locations are swayed by climatic/seasonal/environmental factors; are decided by spiritual and ritual factors.

## Examples

- *Labour:* Examples of what constitutes possible locations for work: agricultural production sites, factories, pastures
- *Trade*: If there is a shop owned by a Focus Group person in a Neighbour Group dominated urban suburb, we would choose the second response (""at places which belong to the Neighbour Group"")

## Theoretical & Empirical Support

Some studies from Africa suggest that if a marketplace is geographically associated with a language group, it is likely that that language will be used in transactions. [Cooper & Carpenter](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:CooperCarpenter1976) ([1976](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:CooperCarpenter1976)) found this to be the case in a multi-site study across Ethiopia. Fieldwork conducted in the Nigerian town of Ika suggests that the language of the town, Ika, is the language of choice in the market, despite traders speaking a variety of other languages including Urhobo, Isekiri, Igbo, and Aniocha ([Onyeche](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Onyeche2002) [2002](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Onyeche2002): 48). [Adeniyi & Bello](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:AdeniyiBello2007) ([2007](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:AdeniyiBello2007)) however report from a market place near the border of Benin Republic and Nigeria that Yoruba is used the most overall, with the local community language Ogu coming in second most used. These examples suggest, at the very least, that if a language is *not* associated with the geographic location of the trading place, it is less likely to be used in transaction.

For Australian Aboriginals, language and particular geographic regions are directly linked, because languages have been directly “planted” in the landscape by Dreamtime heroes. Thus a people can identify with a particular language not necessarily because they speak that language, but because they are linked to the geographical locations where that language is also linked. When crossing territories, it is customary to switch to speaking the language that is associated with the area. It is especially advisable to speak the language associated with that particular area when engaging in spiritual or ritual matters, since speaking another language might invite hostility from non-human forces. ([Rumsey](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Rumsey1993) [1993](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Rumsey1993), and references therein).

e.g. What is the typical pattern of relocation for Focus Group women when starting a new family?

- Focus Group women practically always relocate to Neighbour Group locations
- Focus Group women often relocate to Neighbour Group locations
- Focus Group women sometimes relocate to Neighbour Group locations
- Focus Group women rarely relocate to Neighbour Group locations
- Focus Group women practically never relocate to Neighbour Group locations

## Goal

This question is related to post-marital residential practices. While there are a variety of residential practices that exist in the world, for the purposes of this questionnaire we look at patrilocal practices vs other forms.


## Definitions

*Patrilocal post-marital residency pattern*: where a wife moves to be with the husband once married.


## Examples

- *Focus/Neighbour Group women practically always relocate at Neighbour/Focus Group location*: Tariano (Arawak; Brazil/Colombia) speaking women who marrying Wanano (Tucanoan; Brazil/Colombia) speaking men will live in their husband’s village ([Chernela](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Chernela2013) [2013](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Chernela2013)). Idi (Pahoturi River; Papua New Guinea) speaking women who marry Nen (Yam; Papua New Guinea) speaking men will live in their husband’s village ([Evans](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Evans2012) [2012](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Evans2012)).
- *Focus Group women sometimes relocate to Neighbour Group locations:* These answer options may include cases of matrilocality where the husband relocates (e.g. Hopi (USA), [Eggan](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Eggan1950) [1950](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Eggan1950)), or ambilocality where the husband pays conjugal visits to his wife in her household/village (e.g. Na (Sino-Tibetan; China) speakers used to practice *tisese* “walking back and forth” visiting system where husbands would pay conjugal visits to their wives households and villages ([Shih](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Shih2010) [2010](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Shih2010); c.f. [Stanford et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:StanfordEtAl2018) [2018](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:StanfordEtAl2018)))

## Theoretical Support & Examples

The reason for looking at patrilocal practices vs. other forms is twofold. Firstly, it appears that the most common pattern of post-marital residence pattern after marriage is where a wife moves to be with the husband or husband’s mother’s brother’s household (862/1267 = 68% according to the variable EA011: “Transfer of residence at marriage: prevailing pattern” at D-Place, https://d-place.org/parameters/EA011#1/30/153).

Secondly, sociolinguistic descriptions from parts of the world with high levels of linguistic diversity and multilingualism note how women marrying into a community that “does not speak her language” will have children who have some kind of multilingual capacity. There are reports of children with passive multilingualism (Sui, China as described by [Stanford](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Stanford2009a) [2009a](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Stanford2009a); 2009b), receptive multilingualism (Mawng speakers in Yolngu-matha Australia, [Singer](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Singer2018) [2018](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Singer2018)), active multilingualism in Nen and Idi (Papua New Guinea, [Evans](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Evans2012) [2012](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Evans2012)). Researchers analyse the language ideologies of the community as largely affecting the multilingualism of children. These ideologies appear to be associated with the geographical location of residence (e.g. a child should speak the language of their patriline and patrilineal place as in the Sui case; a woman should speak the language of her husband’s place as in the Papua case). The suggestion from such research is that the wife-to-husband relocation plays a role in creating/maintaining a linguistic environment that fosters multilingual speech on a daily basis.

Possible response:
- Yes
- No


## Goal

This question gives us a sense of any domain-specific patterns of language use in the contact situation. The answers to this question will provide some details on how speakers may speak in this domain, in terms of styles and registers along an axis of speech monitoring. For the purposes of this questionnaire, we define *speech styles* as socio-semantically informed ways of speaking *in contrast to unmonitored and so-called vernacular ways of speaking*.


## Definitions

For the purposes of this questionnaire, we define *speech styles* as socio-semantically informed ways of speaking (e.g. [Bell](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Bell1984) [1984](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Bell1984); [Coupland](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Coupland2007) [2007](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Coupland2007): 2) *in contrast to unmonitored and so-called vernacular ways of speaking*.

Strictly speaking, unmonitored and vernacular ways of speaking could be argued as style unto themselves. The reason for our operational definition of *speech style* is two-fold. We have chosen a binary “monitored vs unmonitored” distinction as an axis of interest due to findings from Labovian sociolinguistics concerning the two modes (see Theoretical & Empirical Support below). Secondly, choosing a binary distinction makes operationalising the question easier, as we cannot *a priori*know or decide what specific speech styles are important in language change phenomena across time and place. As the examples below demonstrate, we can identify a variety of speech style types, all of which have particular uses and nuances depending on the subfield of research, the social domain under investigation, and geographic region of a community.

The term *vernacular*in Labovian sociolinguistics is a natural speech style, in opposition to monitored or standardised speech styles ([Labov](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Labov1972a) [1972](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Labov1972a), cf. [Coupland](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Coupland2009) [2009](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Coupland2009)). [Coupland](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Coupland2016) ([2016](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Coupland2016): 410) summarises the notion of Labovian vernaculars as formally systematic, represent speaking in its most natural and least monitored conditions, and are viewed as the most consequential way of speaking for the study of language change.


## Examples

Examples of speech styles under the operational definition include:

- formal registers
- academic and legalese jargons
- the high variety in diglossic situations
- lects associated with ceremonial events
- kinship registers
- standard varieties (e.g. national standards)
- trade jargons

## Theoretical & Empirical Support

Monitored vs unmonitored was chosen as an axis of importance because sociolinguistic theories inspired by Labovian variationist research identify the latter as the locus where entrenchment of linguistic innovations occur ([Labov](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Labov1972a) [1972](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Labov1972a); cf. [Poplack & Tagliamonte](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:PoplackTagliamonte1999) [1999](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:PoplackTagliamonte1999)). The notion of “vernacular speech” in the Labovian tradition of sociolinguistics is partially related to the amount of attention speakers pay to their speech in different communicative situations (cf. [Coupland](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Coupland2016) [2016](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Coupland2016)). Vernacular speech is typically used when communicating with intimates in familiar contexts ([Labov](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Labov1972a) [1972](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Labov1972a): 208). Evidence of linguistic innovations in unmonitored speech are then taken as a sign of diffusion through the community, and an entrenchment of the innovation in speakers’ repertoires ([Labov](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Labov1972a) [1972](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Labov1972a)).

If we identify a contact domain as that of highly monitored and/or codified speech, we may surmise that this is an unlikely domain of linguistic entrenchment (1). Conversely, if it turns out that unmonitored speech is in fact used in an unexpected domain (such as the knowledge domain), this will enriches the picture of contact scenarios in a way that is consistent with sociolinguistic predictions about the vernacular.

(1) There is of course plenty of evidence across time and place that highly monitored and/or codified speech can be sources of linguistic innovation which consequently spread outside its primary domain. For example, many religious expressions diffuse broadly ([Ferguson](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Ferguson1982) [1982](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Ferguson1982)). The contemporary spread of clinical psychology jargon into everyday American English ([Haslam](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Haslam2016) [2016](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Haslam2016)) is another example of codified speech styles diffusing into more common parlance.

Are any of the following features characteristic when speaking to one’s Neighbour Group in-laws?

- Lexical avoidance
- The use of certain morphosyntactic forms
- The use of certain pronominal forms

## Goal

This question gives us a sense of whether affinal registers are practiced in the contact situation at stake.


## Examples

*Lexical Avoidance*

- Proper name avoidance. The avoidance can extend to homophones of near-homophones (e.g. avoiding words that sound like an in-law’s name (e.g. Datooga (Nilotic, Tanzania), see [Mitchell](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Mitchell2015) [2015](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Mitchell2015)). These can be segmentally based, syllable based (e.g. Kataamba, Ethiopia, see [Fleming](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Fleming2014) [2014](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Fleming2014))). We have not found examples yet, but we would include any semantically based reasons for avoiding lexical items in this group.
- Avoidance of certain lexical items in the presence of in-laws (e.g. described as “mother-in-law languages” in Australia, see [Dixon](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Dixon1971) [1971](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Dixon1971); [McGregor](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:McGregor1989) [1989](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:McGregor1989)). The avoidance can extend to homophones and semantic associations.
- Avoidance of certain pronominal forms (e.g. Aslian languages, see [Kruspe & Burenhult](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:KruspeBurenhult2018) [2018](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:KruspeBurenhult2018))


*Unique morphosyntactic forms*

- Including kinship verbs (cf. [Evans](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Evans2000) [2000](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Evans2000), Iroquian languages, Yuman languages, some Australian languages)
- Bear Lake Athapaskan verbal inflections are marked by stem changes, and “the affinal forms of these verbs are not the dual or plural forms” ([Rushforth](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Rushforth1981) [1981](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Rushforth1981): 33)


*Pronominal forms*

- Pronominal forms that are not unique to an affinal register e.g. use of third person pronominal forms (e.g.), plural pronominal forms (e.g. Korowai, [Stasch](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Stasch2009) [2009](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Stasch2009): 86), vocative forms (some Aslian languages, [Kruspe & Burenhult](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:KruspeBurenhult2018) [2018](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:KruspeBurenhult2018))

## Theoretical & Empirical Support

Affinal relationships stand out in documentary works as relationships that affect linguistic behaviour ([King](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:King2001) [2001](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:King2001); [Blythe](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Blythe2013) [2013](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Blythe2013); [Evans](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Evans2012) [2012](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Evans2012)). There are often strong social obligations between in-laws, which seems to result in strong imperatives for audience design and stance taking. For example lexical avoidance is a cross-culturally observed behaviour in this domain (see [Merlan](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Merlan1981) [1981](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Merlan1981) for an overview in Australia; [Garde](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Garde2014) [2014](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Garde2014) for Bininj Gunwok (Gunwingun; Australia); [Mitchell](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Mitchell2015) ([2015](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Mitchell2015); 2018) for Datooga (Nilotic; Tanzania), and [Stasch](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Stasch2011) [2011](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Stasch2011) for Korowai (Awyu-Dumut; West Papua)). The use of special address terms and registers is also noted for these relationships (see e.g. [Kruspe & Burenhult](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:KruspeBurenhult2018) [2018](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:KruspeBurenhult2018) for Aslian languages), pronominally and verb agreement morphology in Dhimal (Tibeto-Burman, see [King](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:King2001) [2001](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:King2001)), [Rushforth](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Rushforth1981) ([1981](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Rushforth1981)) on pronominal forms in Dane-Zaa (Athabaskan; Canada)).

At the time of writing we are not aware of studies concerning affinal register and linguistics outcomes of contact. But language change phenomena that emerge from kinship registers have been attested, for example, in parts of Australia. [Blythe](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Blythe2013) ([2013](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Blythe2013)) describes the diachronic development of kin-based morphosyntax in Murrinh-Patha.

## Goal
We wish to understand the repercussions of exchange on linguistic behaviour in contact situations. For exchange, we are interested in things such as norms and ideologies surrounding language and ways of speaking around gift exchange, and spaces with ceremonial speech styles.

## Definitions

_Exchange_: (semi-)codified practices of exchange that regulate relationships between individuals and groups as a result. For the purposes of this questionnaire we consider exchange to be characterisable more-so in terms of relationship-building rather than transaction. The motivations for forming the relationships may be various. Our definition of exchange encompasses gift exchange and ceremonial exchange.

For the purposes of the questionnaire, exchange should be treated as distinct from trade. The operational definition of trade is ""the explicit promise of immediate gains or returns, and concerns the acquisition of object, money, or service. Acquisition and transaction of such things is a primary motivator of trade."" The emphasis is on the transactional element of interaction. For exchange, then, the transactional characteristic is either absent or ambiguous. In traditional societies, gift and ceremonial exchange tend to occur between people that are related by kin or other types of close relationships, while trade tends to occur between people and groups that are not intimately connected with each other. Gift and ceremonial exchanges can also occur between rival groups, as a form of negotiation and a sign of mutual recognition.

_Gift exchange_: The exchanging of gifts. Gift exchange can occur at the individual and group-level, between people of similar social status (horizontal exchange) or across social ranks (vertical exchange), and can be more-or-less ritualised. Gift giving entails expectations of return (reciprocal gift giving) but can also function as a mere statement of prestige (of the donor over the recipient, and the other way around) without necessarily implying reciprocity.

## Examples of exchange

Ceremonial Exchange

The po’o a is a ceremonial exchange ritual practiced in the Vaupés (Northwestern Amazonia) to celebrate “life-cycle passages, such as naming, female puberty, male initiation and marriage” ([Chernela](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Chernela2003a) [2003](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Chernela2003a): 797). The po’oa brings together people from different sib settlements, all of which traditionally practice linguistic exogamy with patrilineal descent and patrilocal postmarital residence rules. The po’oa is thus an opportunity for married women to meet with their own descent group and close kinsmen. The high symbolic relevance of this event is linguistically marked by the kana basa, the weeping salutations, a type of sung speech performed by women in their own patrilect. The language exchange proceeds in turns and is accompanied by ritual beer offering. The structure and motives of the kana basa revolve around women’s outsider condition, with respect to their own kin and the kin of the respective husbands and children. The kana basa is thus an example of how ceremonial exchanges can be associated with highly codified speech styles, which are in turn grounded in the specifics of the contact situation where the exchange occurs (for details about the structure and motives of the kana basa, see [Chernela](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Chernela2003a) [2003](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Chernela2003a)).

A world-famous example of ceremonial exchange is the kula, a complex system of exchange centred around the circulation of armshells for necklaces, and regulating inter-island networks and political alliances among the inhabitants of the Trobriand Islands of Papua New Guinea (Malinowski 1984[1922]).

## Theoretical & Empirical Support

Ceremonial exchanges are highly ritualised forms of good exchange, which entail public display of the goods to be exchanged, and the involvement of the whole community in the act of exchange.

Ceremonial exchanges often revolve around interaction between kin groups as defined through intermarriage patterns, and ultimately regulate political alliances between the parties involved ([Strathern & Stewart](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:StrathernStewart2012) [2012](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:StrathernStewart2012): 239). One defining characteristics of ceremonial exchange is delayed reciprocity, which means that the exchange and return of gifts are made on different ceremonial occasions and thus spread over time.

Gift and ceremonial exchanges can also occur between rival groups, as a form of negotiation and a sign of mutual recognition ([Strathern & Stewart](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:StrathernStewart2012) [2012](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:StrathernStewart2012): 242, 253).

## Goal

This section asks about the relationships between family members. Unlike the questions about marriage in the domain of exchange and marriage, this section will ask about interactions between individuals within a family. The domain of exchange and marriage is concerned with macro characterisations of the social institution of marriage, such as patterns of exogamy. Here we are looking at micro elements.


## Definitions

_Family_: At a minimum, a woman and her dependent child. This definition of family can also include a man who is culturally recognised as “the husband” (i.e. a man who is in some culturally recognised relationship analogous to the English word “marriage""). Note that so-called fictive kin (e.g. adoptive father) are also included in this definition of family.

_In-law_: refers to ego’s spouse’s relatives. The spouse's relatives of interest are their parents, and siblings. For example for the purposes of this questionnaire, if you are a married man, your in-laws are your wife's parents, and your wife’s siblings.

_Coresidential group_: a group of people who share a space where matters of child-bearing and rearing, food production, and/or food consumption take place. The coresidential group is identified as a separate group from the family as defined above, since 1) the family may not necessarily reside with one another, and 2) an individual may have multiple coresidential groups at any given time. Examples of coresidential units include “single men’s houses”,

The parameters included under the term kinship for this questionnaire are the following: residency rules (e.g. matrilocal, ambilocal), marriage patterns (e.g. exogamy, endogamy), and relationships with one’s in-laws (i.e. affines).

## Theoretical & Empirical Support

In areas of high linguistic diversity and/or high levels of multilingualism, fieldworkers have noted the propensity of some kind of linguistic exogamy - either as a deliberate ideology (Stenzel, 2005) or as an epiphenomenon of some other exogamy rule (eg. clan exogamy, village exogamy, see Stanford & Pan, 2013). A hypothesis could be made that these cross-linguistic marriages play some role in contact phenomena and resultant linguistic change. General statements and hypotheses concerning inter-language marriages assume that the use of language by the married spouses, and their offspring, is thought to be the locus of “transfer effects” and other contact phenomena. We have attempted to define this social domain in order to capture this interactional locus for the questionnaire.

The notion of ""family and household” in anthropological convention began by identifying the domain as a social unit concerned with procreation and socialisation, “domestic” functions, and the production and consumption of food (c.f. [Yanagisako](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Yanagisako1979) [1979](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Yanagisako1979)). While there appears to be consensus that such functional definitions of families and household miss many of the broader and dynamic elements of family, the generalness of these characteristics helps us to roughly identify this social unit across varying cultural contexts. See also [Bender](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Bender1967) [1967](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Bender1967): 499, and [Goodenough](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Goodenough1980) [1980](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Goodenough1980).

Family and coresidential group were split into two domains in recognition of the fact that the two groups often do not overlap. While in many cultural context they are described as overlapping(e.g. Bali, Corona et. al. 2015), there are many descriptions of contexts where this is either not the case (e.g. the Nayar of western Senegal, [Gough](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Gough1959) [1959](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Gough1959)), or not always the case during the life span of an individual. The particularities are not, however, deemed highly relevant for the purposes of this questionnaire. Given our starting point is the hypothesis that marriage and affinal relationships are a locus of linguistic contact, we are interested in co-residency patterns in-so-far as they may impact the depth of this contact. For example, if a couple are married and live in the same household, the language learning opportunities for both spouses and child are different compared to a situation where a couple are married and have children, but the mother and child do not live with the father.

The elements that can be included under the term kinship are many, but for this questionnaire we focus on the following: descent systems (e.g. unilitaeral, cognatic), residency rules (e.g. matrilocal, ambilocal), marriage patterns (e.g. exogamy, endogamy), and affinal relationships. The reason being that these elements are raised in both qualitative and quantitative studies as variables that affect peoples’ behaviours and social networks: either as a single variable or in some combination with one another. For example, Lansing et. al.’s study on Sumba and Timor (2017) found that if many languages are spoken within a geographical region and rules of postmarital residence are sustained, combined with directional and biased population movement between speech communities, languages will be channeled along uniparental lines (p.12914).

Finally, affinal relationships are singled out due to the many descriptions that note the importance of these relationships on linguistic behaviour. There are often strong social obligations between in-laws, which seems to result in strong imperatives for audience design and stance taking. For example lexical avoidance is a cross-culturally observed behaviour in this domain (Merlan 1981 (overview, Australia), [Garde](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Garde2014) [2014](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Garde2014) for Bininj Gunwok (Gunwingun; Australia), [Mitchell](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Mitchell2015) [2015](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Mitchell2015), 2018 for Datooga (Nilotic; Tanzania), [Stasch](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Stasch2011) [2011](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Stasch2011) for Korowai (Awyu-Dumut; West Papua)). The use of special address terms and registers is also noted for these relationships (e.g. [King](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:King2001) ([2001](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:King2001)) on pronominals and verb agreement morphology in Dhimal (Tibeto-Burman), [Rushforth](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Rushforth1981) ([1981](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Rushforth1981)) on pronominal forms in Dane-Zaa (Athabaskan; Canada)). While a variety of configurations of affinal relationships are possible, for the purposes of this questionnaire we will limit ourselves to whether such relationships do have marked linguistic behaviours, or whether they do not.

## Goal

This question has the same goals as those of CID I2; that is, this question is asking about the input a Focus Group person receives from Neighbour Group people. In this instance we are specifically interested in the input from one's Neighbour Group spouse.

We may surmise that if a Focus Group are exposed to the Neighbour Group language through this domain, they will have opportunities to comprehend or produce the Neighbour language. It is also an indirect measure of asymmetries characterising the contact situation. For instance, if, on average, Neighbour Group people are likely to use the Focus Group language in interactions with Focus Group people, this can be an indication of contextual and/or more fundamental asymmetries in the social dynamics between the two groups within the contact situation at stake.
## Definitions

(If you choose “The Focus Group language” or “Some other language” skip question 16.)

_This is highly contextual_: includes instances of code-switching between one's own language and their spouses' language.
## Theoretical and empirical support

Cross-linguistic marriages have various consequences for language contact, especially if they are frequent enough to register as not uncommon in a community. Bilingual families can result in bilingual children in some contexts, where the input of two languages contribute to a child's bilingual development. In some communities such as the Nmbo speakers of Papua New Guinea, adult women may learn their spouses' languages once they marry into their household as adults. ([Kashima](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Kashima2020a) [2020](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Kashima2020a))

Of course levels of input are one of many factors that affect language contact outcomes. Additional factors such as post-marital residence and language attitudes for example also shape language choice within marriages (e.g., [Epps](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Epps2018) [2018](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Epps2018); [Stanford and Pan](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:StanfordPan2013) [2013](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:StanfordPan2013); summary Pakendorf, Dobrushina, and Khanina 2021 for small-scale multilingual communities; [Potowski](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Potowski2013) [2013](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Potowski2013) for urban contexts). In communities where language shame is attached to languages identified as ""out-group"", children can abandon the active production of their maternal language (e.g. in Sui speaking southern China ala [Stanford](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Stanford2009a) [2009a](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Stanford2009a); Kaveh & Lenz 2021 for children of racially minoritized immigrants in the USA). The levels of input would be one factor that contributes to the configuration of bilingual practices of individuals and communities.

## Theoretical Support
For theoretical and empirical support regarding in-put comprehension and language learning, see I2.

We identify in-law relations specifically as this is a relationship that can be linguistically marked as socially significant.  Descriptive works note the importance of these relationships on linguistic behaviour. There are often strong social obligations between in-laws, which seems to result in strong imperatives for audience design and stance taking. (See DFK38)

## Goals

The aim is to gain some insight into social contact in a domain that focuses on formalised learning. We are interested in teasing apart the relationships between Focus Group and Neighbour Group along the lines of masters and novices, peers of novices, and peers of masters.

We are also interested in getting some sense of the mechanisms that support the instruction that takes place. The prototypical forms of the knowledge domain, such as formal education and/or magico-religious learning, often seem to have specialised oral and graphic-symbolic techniques used to aid and transmit the knowledge. This domain also appear to have cultural authority.

While we have some interest in the nature of the knowledge that is being transmitted (see below under definitions), the precise details are of secondary interest. The main concerns about knowledge in the domains questionnaire are 1) the relationship between the Focus Group and Neighbour Group peoples, and 2) that the domain is recognised by people within the community as having some authority and/or legitimacy.

## Definitions

We use the general terms master to mean the knowledge bearer, and novice to mean the one that is receiving the knowledge.
By formalised we mean loosely two things:
the situation is recognised by people within it as a circumscribed one where knowledge holders are transmitting that knowledge;
there is some kind of understood protocol of instruction and learning;
knowledge transmission occurs in cohorts or groups, rather than between individual master & novice pairs.
The protocol of may be rigidly defined in the form of a curriculum, or it may be loosely understood as, for example, age-sensitive and learnt at various points throughout one's life.
The knowledge learnt should emphasise recognition of things rather than physical skill; that is, the learner is required to memorise and recognise names of things, stretches of text, and abstract knowledge pertaining to the world (natural, supernatural or otherwise). Thus we include knowledge pertaining to the environment (e.g. botanical knowledge, navigational knowledge). In addition, the knowledge learnt should have a linguistic component, such as the knowledge of narratives, specialised lexicon, oral/orthographic texts, and learning of orthographies.

## Examples of knowledge domains

Note that these are specific examples of knowledge domains, and not examples of social contact in knowledge domains.
- Spaces dedicated to study of theological texts such as Sanskrit Dharmaśāstra (Indosphere).
- Temple administered secular education of literacy and arithmetic for children (Terakoya) in Edo period Japan.
- For the Hopi ""the mechanism of knowledge transmission is social rather than individualistic"" according to one description Glowacka 1998:389), where children receive ritual knowledge over the course of their lives from extended family, and adult men are initiated into ceremonial sodalities (ibid.). Sodalities are age and cohort-based groupings of non-kin, so fulfil our definition 3 and qualify for the knowledge domain.

## Theoretical & Empirical Support

_Education_
The literature on language contact/bilingual/multilingual education is often framed in terms of ideologies of homogenisation. Lambert & Spolsky (2006) describe schools as  modifying the language of pupils to avoid “bad” language as defined by an ideology. Schools are often found to be replicating national cultures ([Johnson](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Johnson1980) [1980](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Johnson1980)), and the nationalist ideologies of a monolingual state (e.g. [Szabó](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Szabo2015) [2015](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Szabo2015) on Hungarian state schools). Because schools are instrumental in shaping students’ language attitudes, education systems have been criticised for perpetuating a self-hatred and shame around languages and varieties that fall foul of the ideology (e.g. [Givón](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Givon1971) [1971](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Givon1971) for colonial context, [Kroskrity](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Kroskrity2004) [2004](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Kroskrity2004) for immigrant context).

Recent discussions of bi/multilingual education are framed in terms of language rights, though the current towards homogenisation still remains strong. Bilingual language education has been suggested as crucial in aiding language revitalisation, though as [Baker](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Baker2003) ([2003](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Baker2003)) suggests education alone is insufficient, given the linguistic pressures of the greater language ecology. In the past few decades the expressed ideology of the classroom has shifted somewhat towards that of an “inclusive education”, but as Miller (2012) points out this is merely homogenisation in another form and renders multilingualism invisible (see also Janík and Goldberger 2023 on multilingual schools in the Czech Republic).

Literacy and education one and the same in many contexts, both in the present and past (see OL1 and OL3). Literacy is one of the factors that leads towards homogenisation, although historical evidence suggests that the tendency is for orthographies to also display a lot of variation without a concerted effort to enforce standardisation (see Suleiman 2011 for Arabic).

We have not explored the effects of education on language in the periods preceding European colonial expansion. We hazard that overall historical access to education was more limited than the present day, resulting in the formation of a privileged group of people who had some form of social and/or political power in society.

_Religion_
The relationship between religion and language, and language contact, is complex. On the one hand there are trends towards standardisation and the reduction of linguistic diversity, and on the other there are tendencies for linguistic-cultural innovations and social indexation.

Religion and standardisation often appear together where the creation and/or translations of religious texts seem to encourage a process of language standardisation (see [Mühleisen](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Muhleisen2007) [2007](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Muhleisen2007)). This may be because, as [Fudge](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Fudge2006) ([2006](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Fudge2006)) notes, written texts are produced to create authority when a religious/spiritual group is literate (p.526). The writing process of a religious text often involves the establishment of a definitive canon, leading towards the establishment of consistent expressions associated with the religion. Arabic, for example, is noted as becoming a literary language through the need to standardise the Qur’an  ([Baker](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Baker2009) [2009](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Baker2009): 329).

In the case of European colonialism there were also strong ideological currents pushing towards language standardsation. For example [Errington](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Errington2001) ([2001](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Errington2001)) notes that dialects of Shona were standardized into territorially distinct languages in Zimbabwe (p.24). Given that European colonialism and Christianity went hand-in-hand as a form of cultural importation/imposition, the ideology of standardisation associated with nationalism was part of the mix.

While translation leads to codification on the one hand, in the case of Bible translation it has been noted that vernacular varieties also get translated thereby, arguably, increasing linguistic diversity in literary spaces. For example Scots English and Bärndütsch (a Swiss German variety) have Bible translations within the context of larger standard/national languages ([Mühleisen](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Muhleisen2007) [2007](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Muhleisen2007): 481). [Sanneh](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Sanneh1993) ([1993](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Sanneh1993)) argues that vernacularisation and translation is in the very nature of Christianity as a creed, and points out how the process of Bible translation has in some respects promoted and strengthened local languages in Africa (see also [Sanneh](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Sanneh1989) [1989](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Sanneh1989)). The effect of introducing literacy into historically non-literate groups has many consequences, with the social elevation of some languages/dialects which gain literary status through religious texts (see [Goody](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Goody1968) [1968](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Goody1968) and chapters within).

The adoption of a religion may also lead groups to forge new social categories as the religion acts as a social index and marker of identification (e.g. as argued by [Schieffelin](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Schieffelin2007) [2007](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Schieffelin2007) for Bosavi, Papua New Guinea). Oral religions and spiritualities may also carve out social niches, resulting in the emergence of a socially recognised language. [Blake](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Blake2006) ([2006](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Blake2006)) notes that special vocabularies from secret languages are reported as taught as part of male initiation in various Australian languages (p. 592)

Language contact through religion noticeably results in new lexical items, but as [Khachaturyan](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Khachaturyan2017) ([2017](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Khachaturyan2017)) notes, morphosyntactic innovations can also be introduced via ecclesiastical language contact. She presents the example of the Mano language where there is variability in possessive constructions in religious formulas. One variant follows the pattern of possession in the carrier language of Kpelle where possesum are unmodified by a possessor.

Semantic-pragmatic innovations can also be induced through religion and language contact. Since ecclesiastical language is used in highly circumscribed social context, these may produce new contexts or expand pre-existing ones that beget new speech activities. Schieffelin (2017) for example documents the introduction publicly stated inferences of others' thoughts in Bosavi, Papua New Guinea ([Schieffelin](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Schieffelin2007) [2007](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Schieffelin2007))

## Goal
In this domain we wish to get some insight into interaction as it pertains to labour, production, and economic activity. Here we consider both domestic and public modes of economic activity. We will exclude economic activities that primarily concern trade, or overlap with labour. These activities can be addressed in the relevant domains of this questionnaire.

For some societies, the domains of local community and labour will overlap significantly. If local community and domain of labour are one and the same, please answer for both domains.

## Definitions

_Labour_: Work. Activities that pertain to production and consumption, which transform the natural world into the cultural domain.
## Examples

- Subsistence work such as agricultural labour, fishing, animal husbandry.
- Production of cultural matter, such as physical structures, crafts, tools, other kinds of material culture.
- Exclude activities that primarily concern trade, or overlap with labour.


## Theoretical & Empirical Support

Economic activity is defined broadly to mean human labour and production by which people transform nature into a cultural domain ([Seremetakis](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Seremetakis2007) [2007](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Seremetakis2007): 101). Labour is “the activity linking human social groups to the material world around them”, meaning human labour is always social labour in some way, and therefore relational (Schultz & Lavenda 1990:406, [Seremetakis](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Seremetakis2007) [2007](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Seremetakis2007)). Production, specifically the notion of the modes of production, is “a specific, historically occurring set of social relations through which labor is deployed to wrest energy from nature by means of tools, skills, organization, and knowledge” ([Wolf](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Wolf1982) [1982](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Wolf1982): 75). In other words, in this domain we will target what is typically understood as “work” in the Western world.

Since we are working with a global sample, we will consider that there are two major types of economies which form a continuum. On the one hand there are economies that predominantly revolve around domestic mode of production. In this mode, work activity, production, and consumption all occur in the domestic sphere (Seremetakis 2007:102). On the other hand there are public modes of production, where there is a split between the public and private domains, and the individual goes out to the public domain to sell his/her labor ([Seremetakis](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Seremetakis2007) [2007](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Seremetakis2007): 102). These modes roughly, though not always, overlap with certain kinds of socio-political organisations: domestic modes with hunter-gatherers and horticultural societies, public modes with complex societies. Complex societies can be characterised as having at least three levels of hierarchically arranged administration (e.g. [Wenke](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Wenke1980) [1980](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Wenke1980): 431), and this tends to result in some form of social stratification such as class or caste ([Berdan](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Berdan1989) [1989](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Berdan1989): 79).

Language use in modern workplaces are relatively well-researched, though there are a wide array of workplace types, as well as societal contexts, to be covered. The (post-)industrialised workplace has been of interest since these are spaces “where everyone at some stage is new to the environment and has to be socialised into its particular linguistic and cultural environment” ([Roberts](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Roberts2010) [2010](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Roberts2010): 214; Roberts & Sarangi, 1999). There is socialisation into the institutionalised forms of speaking and learning the metalanguage of the workplace, but also a space of personal and social discourses (Holmes & Stubbe, 2003). Work places in migration contexts are often multilingual (Gunnarsson 2013), and use of languages in such a space are greatly affected by greater language (and/or ethnic/cultural/national) attitudes and ideologies ([Roberts](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Roberts2010) [2010](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Roberts2010)). For example, second language socialization “often occurs in a relatively hostile environment” ([Roberts](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Roberts2010) [2010](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Roberts2010): 217), for example in countries such as Canada where migrant workers are involved in ""unskilled labour"" (Li, 2000; Katz, 2000). On the other hand professionals in cosmopolitan transnational corporate environments tend to have more egalitarian relationships across different strata of staff (e.g. “bilingual professionals” in Day & Wagner, 2007) .

For the purposes of this domains questionnaire, the interactional patterns of the private mode of production will be assumed to mirror those of the Local Community closely. Private modes of production blur the line between domains of labour and household as understood in industrialised contexts, and so we assume that modes and norms of interaction are similar enough to assume analogy. Of course one would expect there are modes of labour that straddle the line between private and public (e.g. collective group works for the benefit of a large group).

Authors: [](ContributionTable?__template__=property.md&property=contributor#cldf:DLC)
This domain concerns the surroundings closest to the household environment, but outside the realm of family and kin. In modern societies, the local community space coincides somewhat with the notions of a “private sphere” and captures social ties such as friendships and acquaintances, where unmonitored speech likely occurs. Within this space, we are interested in capturing face-to-face interactions between both individuals and groups.

By local community we mean a space of interaction, which is not necessarily bounded to a geographical place. This is done in order to capture mobile groups (e.g. nomads) and other communities of practice. Examples of local community vary depending on type of residential and living arrangements. They include things like neighbourhood, band or village.

For some contact situations, the domains of local community and labour will overlap significantly. If local community and domain of labour are one and the same, please answer for both domains.

## Goal

Here we wish to understand what kind of interactions occur between Focus Group and Neighbour Group people in the contexts closest to the household environment, but outside the realm of family and kin. Within this space, we are interested in capturing face-to-face interactions between both individuals and groups where so-called ""unmonitored speech"" is likely to occur.

For some societies, the domains of local community and labour will overlap significantly. If local community and domain of labour are one and the same, please answer for both domains.

## Definitions

Local Community: Domain concerning the surroundings closes to the household environment, but outside the realm of family and kin. A space of interaction that may extend beyond a bounded geographical place (this is done in order to capture mobile groups (e.g. nomads) and other communities of practice.

Unmonitored speech: Ways of speaking where speakers are paying less attention to the forms they produce, compared to situations where they do (such as formal situations). Overlaps somewhat with notions of ""vernacular speech"".

## Examples

- Neighbourhood
- Band
- Village
- We expect examples of local community to vary depending on type of residential and living arrangements.

## Theoretical & Empirical Support

Given that unmonitored speech is identified as a likely locus of linguistic innovations (cf. [Labov](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Labov1966) [1966](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Labov1966); 1972, and his definition of ‘vernacular speech’), we wish to investigate the local community as a space where this kind of informal interactional registers are likely to be used. For example, it has been suggested that in diglossic situations, the “low” variety, which tends to be used in contexts associated with the ‘private sphere’ is often left unmonitored, and, thus, open to more interference and contact effects ([Sayahi](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Sayahi2007) [2007](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Sayahi2007): 48). By using the label ‘unmonitored speech’, we thus wish to capture a variety of speech styles that are typically connected with interactions beyond family and kin, but within the realm of the private sphere, which, in our definition, coincides with the space of the local community. Examples of these unmonitored speech styles are sociolects, dialects, as well as registers related to different communities of practice etc.

DTR,Trade,"# [](ContributionTable?__template__=property.md&property=name#cldf:DTR)

Authors: [](ContributionTable?__template__=property.md&property=contributor#cldf:DTR)

## Goal

Trade is a domain of interest where there is a clear case of contact, where groups come together for exchange. Put another way, trade situations are fruitful for investigating the relationship between groups.

## Definitions

For this questionnaire, trade is characterised by two aspects. The first is that there is a clear understanding by participants that there will be immediate gains or returns. If not immediate, there is an explicit understanding of future returns. “Explicit” here includes strong cultural norms, such that violating the norm of expected return would result in a predictable and clear penalty.

The second characteristic of trade in this questionnaire is that the acquisition of objects, money, or service, is a clear motivator of the exchange. This domain thus excludes acts of exchange whose purposes can be characterised more-so as building relationships, such as gift-giving. Exchanges that are simultaneously a transaction and relationship building are considered trade transactions for this questionnaire. The key point of interest is that there is some transaction involved.

We define trade narrowly in an attempt to distinguish it from social exchange, even though much has been written about how difficult it is to separate these activities from one another (see Strathen and Stewart 2012). For the purposes of this questionnaire, we consider trade to be distinguishable from other kinds of exchange because (1) it is mostly based on the (immediate) exchange of unlike items, (2) it may involve bargaining and value setting while gift and ceremonial exchange tend not to have this process, and (3) trade can occur between people and groups that are not necessarily connected with each other by kin or other types of close interpersonal relationships. The Domain of Social Exchange is covered in a different section of the questionnaire.

## Examples

- Market places in Cameroon ([Connell](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Connell2009) [2009](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Connell2009))
- Trade along the Hanseatic networks of northern Europe

## Theoretical & Empirical Support

Linguistically, trade contexts have been hypothesised as or resulting in a range of linguistic consequences. These include trade jargons (Rickford and McWhorter 1997:240), conventionalised trade registers (e.g. Chinook Jargon, Thomas 1953), and these varieties may even come to be spoken outside the domains of trade (e.g. Pidgin Fijian, [Siegel](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Siegel1987) [1987](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Siegel1987)). These linguistic consequences can arise from different power dynamics in trade, such as between two groups of relatively equal power (e.g. Russenorsk, Pidgin Yimas) or asymmetries in power (e.g. Swahili).

Case studies of language use in trade have also revealed various dynamics at play between individuals, groups, and group conceptualisation. For example [Connell](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Connell2009) ([2009](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Connell2009)) found that language use in a multi-ethnic and multilingual market place of Cameroon shows “language choice appeared most strongly correlated with interactants’ “ethnicity” (p.138). In this case study, Mambila varieties were used among individuals primarily identifying as Mambila, while Grassfields Bantu language Bamoun [bax] was used with visiting Bamoun traders. [Verschik](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Verschik2011) ([2011](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Verschik2011)) found that Finnish tourists and Estonian service providers both may accommodate to each other, although with slightly different strategies due to the amounts of prior exposure of the other language. Both these case studies suggest that the larger language ecology and milieu are indeed reflected linguistically in this inherently relational domain.

## Goal

This question is asking about the input a Focus Group person receives from Neighbour Group people in a given social domain. We may surmise that if a Focus Group are exposed to the Neighbour Group language through this domain, they will have opportunities to comprehend or produce the Neighbour language.

It is also an indirect measure of asymmetries characterising the contact situation. For instance, if, on average, Neighbour Group people are likely to use the Focus Group language in interactions with Focus Group people, this can be an indication of contextual and/or more fundamental asymmetries in the social dynamics between the two groups within the contact situation at stake.

- *This is highly contextual*: encompasses interaction in which more than one language is used, including but not limited to phenomena that come under the umbrella terms ""code-switching"" and/or ""code-mixing"".

## Theoretical Support

The amount and type of linguistic input an individual receives has a direct consequence on an individual's linguistic output. Points of contention regarding input include how the input is processed into acquisition (see [Barcroft and Wong](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:BarcroftWong2012) [2012](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:BarcroftWong2012) in the context of second language acquisition), and what constitutes an adequate threshold for input to lead to acquisition; that, the role of frequency.

There is much discussion around kinds of frequency (e.g. type vs token, relative vs absolute) and how these frequencies affect different kinds of linguistic structures, (see [Lieven](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Lieven2010) [2010](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Lieven2010)). The interaction of frequency with other factors such as salience and communicative intent are also a complicating factor in understanding the role of frequency. What remains consistent throughout the fine-grained discussion, however, is the consensus that frequency plays a role in how humans build models of linguistic systems. Frequency is relevant in both first and second language acquisitions (see Ambridge et al 2015 for the former, [Gass](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Gass2018) [2018](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Gass2018) for the latter), learning sociolinguistic variation (see [Ellis](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Ellis2002) [2002](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Ellis2002): 170-3), and grammaticalisation ([Bybee and Hopper](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:BybeeHopper2001) [2001](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:BybeeHopper2001), [Bybee](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Bybee2003) [2003](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Bybee2003)).

Input and frequency are both related to humans' ability for statistical learning.
Evidence suggests that statistical learning models can account for language acquisition from infants through to adults (see Erickson & Thiessen2015). Different models of statistical learning will emphasise different learning mechanisms, but all acknowledge the roles of linguistic input, frequency, variability, distribution, and co-occurrence probabilities.

- Very well
- Well

- Poorly

## Goal
This question aims to get a sense of how much a Focus Group person would comprehend the linguistic input they are receiving. For example, in situations of receptive multilingualism, we may expect the Focus Group person understands the Neighbour Group’s language without necessarily actively using it in a given interactional context.

An individual's comprehension of a target language theoretically can affect acquisition. A learner's comprehension of the input often reflect their prior experience with the target language; either purely as input or through outputting production themselves. Put another way, a learner's experience can also reflect a learner's proficiency of the target language.
## Definitions

The scale is as follows:

- *Very well:* Focus Group people have high comprehension skills of Neighbour Group language & understand the contextual situation very well.
- *Well*: Focus Group people have low comprehension skills of Neighbour Group language but understand the contextual situation very well.
- *Somewhat:* Focus Group people have low comprehension skills of Neighbour Group language but understand the contextual situation to some extent.
- *Poorly*: Focus Group people have low comprehension skills of Neighbour Group language and do not understand the contextual situation too well either.
- *Very poorly*: Focus Group people have almost no comprehension of the Neighbour Group language and do not understand the contextual situation.
## Theoretical Support
Input plays a major role in the acquisition and usage of additional languages.

An influential but contested hypothesis regarding the relationship between comprehension and acquisition is known as Krashen's input hypothesis (1980, 1982, 1985). In essence the hypothesis suggested that for successful acquisition of a target language the input must be comprehended and be at one stage above the learner's current level. In it's stronger form, Krashen (1998) has suggested that “extremely high levels of language and literacy"" can be acquired without any production (p.177). As Mayo and Solar (2012) summarise, however, Krashen's hypothesis has been severly criticised on many grounds; amoung them, the issue of unclear definitions, and the difficulty in testing some of his proposed constructs (p.214)

The detailed relationship between comprehension and acquisition appears to be unclear. [Loschky](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Loschky1994) ([1994](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Loschky1994)) found no evidence that greater comprehension of a target language leads to greater acquisition in an experiment investigating adult learners. Ellis, Tanaka & Yamazaki (1994) found in an experimental set up that comprehension gained through interactionally modified tuition (or meaning negotiation) aids learning ""because it (interaction) gives them control over the input they receive and enables them to systematically identify and solve comprehension problems."" (p.481). What is intuitively clear, however, is that input comprehension is required to some degree for production-based acquisition.

The models of language acquisition implicit in these studies is one of an active type where the learner's target is to produce the target language in a fashion that approximates an abstracted standard. Other types of multilingualisms, such as receptive multilingualism, emphasise communicative ability based on comprehension of the interlocutor's language. In such cases, the relationship between comprehension of input and production is moot. Some degree of comprehension is, however, clearly required to engage in receptive multilingual interaction. The kinds of multilingual interactions engaged in by receptive multilinguals is highly dependent on each other's comprehension of the other's language, and whether they share/have some comprehension of the other's discourse community (e.g. see [Zeevaert](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Zeevaert2007) [2007](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Zeevaert2007))

## Goal

This question is trying to get a sense of what languages are actively spoken by Focus Group people, within the contact situation at stake.

The possible answers have been designed in order to account for the fact that linguistic interactions across time and space are often multilingual, and that multilingual interactions manifest themselves in a variety of ways, ranging from the use of a third-party language, receptive multilingual communication and contextually-governed switches between the languages shared by the people involved in interaction and within the contact situation at stake.

## Theoretical Support

Language contact outcomes are theorised to be affected by the bilingualism of the speakers in the contact situation. We may posit that the more opportunities a person has to speak a target language, the more they will develop proficiencies approximating those of fluent target speakers.* This is then thought to have consequences for language contact outcomes. For example, having a large number of adult L2 learners of a language are thought to result in simplification of the target language (e.g. [Lupyan and Dale](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:LupyanDale2010) [2010](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:LupyanDale2010), [Bentz and Winter](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:BentzWinter2013) [2013](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:BentzWinter2013)), while communities with receptive/reciprocal multilingualism can maintain linguistic differences across various levels of linguistic structure ([Lüpke](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Lupke2016) [2016](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Lupke2016)).

Production of a target language is generally thought to be necessary for the acquisition of productive bilingualism.  For example some SLA studies have found than meaning-oriented communicative tasks may be more effective learning than mechanic production tasks (such as drills) (e.g. Morgan-Brown & Bowden 2006, [Toth](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Toth2006) [2006](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Toth2006)). The caveat here is that language learning outside the classroom is rarely mechanical, so the consequences of this finding on out-of-classroom language contact is unclear.

SLA research has also found evidence to suggest that input alone may be superior production tasks in the classroom (e.g. [Farley](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Farley2004) [2004](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Farley2004)). Proponents of this perspective, however, emphasise that input is ""necessary for acquisition"" but not ‘‘sufficient for developing the ability to use language in a communicative context’’ (Lee & VanPatten, 2003, p. 168, emphasis original). That is, if one is to be an active bilingual, input alone is insufficient for learning. This perspective aligns with a broad characterisation of receptive bilingualism ([Rehbein et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:RehbeinEtAl2012) [2012](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:RehbeinEtAl2012)) where a person may have good levels of comprehension in a language without any production abilities, in part due to the exposure they have had of the other language (e.g. Gooskens 2019 for related languages; [Singer and Harris](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:SingerHarris2016) [2016](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:SingerHarris2016) for unrelated languages in northern Australia).

Another caveat is that many SLA studies are based around classroom learning, where the target is often a ""native-like"" level of accuracy and fluency. It is not clear whether this kind of goal is common across the  diversity of multilingual communities, nor is it clear what this kind of goal has on the production of the target language.

## Goal

In this question we wish to get a sense of whether simplification in speech occurs when speakers deduce comprehension issues from their interlocutor. This phenomena is sometimes described as *foreigner-directed speech* (FDS).

We interpret the absence of FDS as one way of inferring that the people in the Neighbour Group comprehend the language of the Focus Group well enough.

The answer to this question is treated as one of a number of factors that play a role in affecting the outcomes of language change. The factor by itself is likely unable to affect outcomes, but in combination with other factors, is thought to play a role.


## Definitions

*Foreigner-directed speech (FDS)* is a type of simplified speech that “native speakers” of a language direct at “non-native speakers”.

One way to infer foreigner-directed speech is by thinking about any relevant characteristics of child-directed speech in the community (e.g. frequent use of imperatives as documented for Swahili (Atlantic-Congo, cf. [Deen](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Deen2005) [2005](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Deen2005)) and Murrinhpatha (Southern Daly, cf. [Forshaw et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:ForshawEtAl2017) [2017](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:ForshawEtAl2017)) and whether they happen to occur in interactions between Focus and Neighbour Group in this domain, and from the perspective of the Focus Group.


## Examples

Features of English FDS include:

- omission of inflectional marking ([Ferguson](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Ferguson1975) [1975](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Ferguson1975))
- redundancy (e.g. via reduplication) ([Ferguson](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Ferguson1975) [1975](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Ferguson1975))
- lexical substitution ([Ferguson](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Ferguson1975) [1975](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Ferguson1975))
- hyperarticulation of vowels ([Uther et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:UtherEtAl2007) [2007](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:UtherEtAl2007))
- use of “or-choice” questions ([Hatch](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Hatch1978) [1978](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Hatch1978))
- preference for left-dislocation ([Hatch et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:HatchEtAl1978) [1978](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:HatchEtAl1978)).
- Discourse structure differences have also been found between native English speaker dyads as compared with native speaker and non-native speaker dyads ([Long](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Long1981) [1981](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Long1981)).

## Theoretical & Empirical Support

“Proportion of adult learners” is a factor that is sometimes raised in discussions of language contact and change. The implication is that these adult learners are “incomplete learners” of the language under investigation. An important component of this “incomplete learner” picture is, then, what input these adult learners are receiving, and how they are learning. This question aims to touch upon this by raising the issue of FDS.

A classic study on similarities between foreigner- and child-directed speech based on English is [Uther et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:UtherEtAl2007) ([2007](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:UtherEtAl2007)). The similarities reported in this and similar studies are, however, far from universal. In the Kaluli speech community of Papua New Guinea, for instance, simplification patterns in child-directed speech are purposely avoided because considered to be detrimental to effective language acquisition ([Schieffelin](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Schieffelin1990) [1990](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Schieffelin1990)). A recent study which brings cross-linguistic corpus evidence in support of the idea that foreigner-directed (written) speech is simpler than native-directed (written) speech is [Berdicevskis](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Berdicevskis2020) ([2020](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Berdicevskis2020)).

- Very fluently
- Fluently
- Somewhat fluently
- A little fluently
- Not fluently at all


## Goal

We may surmise that the individual will have had to spend a lot of time to gain experience in producing the Neighbour Group Language if they are very fluent speakers. Some examples of concrete scenarios include being raised in a multilingual community from birth, or learning later in life but with intensive usage.

The answer to this question is treated as one of a number of factors that play a role in affecting the outcomes of language change. The factor by itself is likely unable to affect outcomes, but in combination with other factors, is thought to play a role.


## Definitions

We define *fluency* as:

- ease/smoothness of spontaneous speech production, in so far as it gives some indication of how much interaction Focus Group people may have had with the Neighbour Group in order to become proficient in the Neighbour Group Language.
- So-called “age of acquisition” should not be a considering factor.
- Here we avoid any precise or prescriptive characterisation of fluency, or any definition of fluency based on the concept of “a native speaker”.


The scale we use is as follows:

- *Very fluently*: Almost a complete absence of linguistic markers that differentiate the speech of a Focus Group person from a Neighbour Group person, e.g. or use of features that fall entirely beneath the level of speaker/interlocutor consciousness.
- *Fluently*: High level of production, but a few linguistic markers of “late acquisition”, such as having an accent. A non-native linguist would not necessarily be able to ascertain level of fluency from a textual transcription without audio.
- *Somewhat fluently*: Many markers of late acquisition, but does not impede communication and comprehension. A non-native linguist would likely be able to ascertain level of fluency from a textual transcription without audio.
- *A little fluently*: Many markers of late acquisition. It hampers communication and comprehension.
- *Not fluently at all*: Usage limited to lexical items, and rote learned set phrases.

## Examples

Broadly speaking, a fluent speaker is someone who is perceived as havinɡ a hiɡh level of oral proficiency in a given language. In the literature on second language acquisition, fluency is considered to be one dimension of L2 profiency, often measured, for instance, in terms of (perceived) speech rate (as a combination of both the speed of talking and the extent of pausing). For an overview, see [Peltonen](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Peltonen2023) ([2023](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Peltonen2023)).


## Theoretical & Empirical Support

The second language acquisition literature defines *proficiency in the L2* as a multifaceted notion, which can be broken down in at least three distinguished, yet interdependent, dimensions: accuracy (or correctness), fluency (perception of ease/confidence in L2 production), and complexity (as in both learner difficulty and system complexity of the L2). For an overview see [Housen & Kuiken](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:HousenKuiken2009) ([2009](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:HousenKuiken2009)).

## Goal

This question intends to identify whether a group conceptualises ways of speaking a certain way as a reified ""language"".


## Definitions

emic = a locally understood; as perceived by community insiders


## Examples

A prototypical example of language ideologies of reification are nationalist linkages between language, nation, and people.

Reification of languages are also attested non-nationalist frames of meaning. Pakedorf et. al (2021) have noted that linguistic reification in small-scale multilingual societies is often spatially and/or politically anchored (p.839). A local place may be viewed as having a language, or being strongly associated with a  language. Either way there appears to be some kind of imagined idea of (a) way of speaking.

## Theoretical Support

Particular uses of the notion translanguaging take the theoretical stance that bilinguals who speak/sign multiple languages have an internally undifferentiated and unitary linguistic system, therefore that  ‘languages’	have no linguistic or cognitive reality (as pointed out by [Cummins](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Cummins2021) [2021](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Cummins2021) and others). Many argue that this is empirically untrue. For example an fMRI study by Abutelebi et al. (2008) demonstrate that German-French bilingual speakers mobilise different areas of the brain in order to inhibit the effects of the other language when speaking one. As [Cummins](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Cummins2021) ([2021](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Cummins2021)) points out, there appears to be a conflation of fluidity in utilising multilingual repertoires in practice, with the idea that this reflects a cognitive reality: ""The hybridity	of linguistic practices	and the	complexity	of linguistic repertoires	‘do	not	carry	the	consequence that languages	do	not	exist	or that	named	languages	are	irrelevant’ (Grin,	2018:	257).""

The lack of cross-linguistic investigation into the question of whether communities objectify ways of speaking (as ""languages"" or something similar) prompted us to include this question in the questionnaire.

## Goal

By this question we collect data on the number of native speakers so that we can correlate it with other sociolinguistic factors, such as density of social networks (S6/7). Our purpose is to test, for instance, Trudgill's hypothesis that linguistic complexity is affected by several sociolinguistic factors in tandem, including community size, and social network density, as well as [Reali et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:RealiEtAl2018) 's ([2018](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:RealiEtAl2018)) simulation result that population size affects ease vs. difficulty of diffusion within populations.


## Definitions

The term *native-like speakers* encompasses two types of people. First, it refers to those members of the language group who have learned the Focus Group language as the first language. Second, it refers to those members of the Focus Group who have learned the language since childhood and their competence in the language is comparable to first language learners.


This question and possible answers are adapted from question SCCS1122 in the Standard Cross-Cultural Sample ([Murdock & White](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:MurdockWhite1969) [1969](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:MurdockWhite1969); [White](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:White2009) [2009](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:White2009)) that is available in D-PLACE ([Kirby et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:KirbyEtAl2016) [2016](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:KirbyEtAl2016); 2018c; see https://d-place.org/parameters/SCCS1122#2/14.3/151.3)


## Examples

- Focus Group = Finnish, Neighbour Group = Swedish, contemporary situation:According to the 2018 census of Finland, there are 4,840,000 L1 users of Finnish in Finland, and 30,000 speakers of Tornedalen Finnish speakers in Sweden. The Ethnologue lists the ""total users in all countries"" as 5,114,040. The answer to this question would therefore be option 6: 1,000,000-9,999,999 speakers.

## Theoretical & Empirical Support

Number of native speakers has been used in many recent studies in language typology and psycholinguistics (e.g. [Lupyan & Dale](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:LupyanDale2010) [2010](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:LupyanDale2010); [Sinnemäki & Di Garbo](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:SinnemakiDiGarbo2018) [2018](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:SinnemakiDiGarbo2018); [Raviv et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:RavivEtAl2021) [2021](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:RavivEtAl2021)). Some researchers, such as [Lupyan & Dale](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:LupyanDale2010) ([2010](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:LupyanDale2010)), use it as a proxy for language contact effects. The justification for doing that is the hypothesis that the greater the speech population of a language is, the more likely it is also being learned as a second language by outsiders. Based on typological data this hypothesis may be incorrect, because population size does not seem to correlate very strongly with, for instance, the proportion of second language speakers in the community ([Sinnemäki & Di Garbo](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:SinnemakiDiGarbo2018) [2018](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:SinnemakiDiGarbo2018)). Peter [Trudgill](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Trudgill2004) ([2004](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Trudgill2004); 2010; 2011) has argued that instead of using population size as a sole predicting factor of typological variation, it should be considered instead together with density of social networks and the amount of language contact in the community. [Sinnemäki & Di Garbo](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:SinnemakiDiGarbo2018) ([2018](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:SinnemakiDiGarbo2018)) provide initial evidence substantiating this claim typologically. [Raviv et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:RavivEtAl2021) 's ([2021](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:RavivEtAl2021)) experimental study further show that community size in itself does not affect learnability of morphological complexity, but [Raviv et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:RavivEtAl2019) 's ([2019](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:RavivEtAl2019)) study suggest that large communities may create more systematic languages. In addition, community size seems to be in a complex relationship with social network structure and mechanisms of transmission within the network, as suggested by computer simulations on cumulative cultural evolution ([Cantor et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:CantorEtAl2021) [2021](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:CantorEtAl2021)).

However, there may be some room for considering population size as a meaningful factor on its own, too. Population size seems to affect the rate of language change in that large populations gain words more rapidly, while small populations lose words more rapidly ([Bromham et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:BromhamEtAl2015) [2015](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:BromhamEtAl2015); [Greenhill et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:GreenhillEtAl2018) [2018](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:GreenhillEtAl2018)).

In this questionnaire we collect data on the number of native speakers so that we can correlate it with other sociolinguistic factors, such as density of social networks ([S6](S6.md)/7). Our purpose is to test, for instance, Trudgill's hypothesis that linguistic complexity is affected by several sociolinguistic factors in tandem, including community size, and social network density, as well as [Reali et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:RealiEtAl2018) 's ([2018](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:RealiEtAl2018)) simulation result that population size affects ease vs. difficulty of diffusion within populations.

Number of native speakers has been used in many recent studies in language typology and psycholinguistics (e.g. [Lupyan & Dale](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:LupyanDale2010) [2010](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:LupyanDale2010); [Sinnemäki & Di Garbo](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:SinnemakiDiGarbo2018) [2018](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:SinnemakiDiGarbo2018); [Raviv et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:RavivEtAl2021) [2021](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:RavivEtAl2021)). Some researchers, such as [Lupyan & Dale](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:LupyanDale2010) ([2010](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:LupyanDale2010)), use it as a proxy for language contact effects. The justification for doing that is the hypothesis that the greater the speech population of a language is, the more likely it is also being learned as a second language by outsiders. Based on typological data this hypothesis may be incorrect, because population size does not seem to correlate very strongly with, for instance, the proportion of second language speakers in the community ([Sinnemäki & Di Garbo](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:SinnemakiDiGarbo2018) [2018](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:SinnemakiDiGarbo2018)). Peter [Trudgill](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Trudgill2004) ([2004](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Trudgill2004); 2010; 2011) has argued that instead of using population size as a sole predicting factor of typological variation, it should be considered instead together with density of social networks and the amount of language contact in the community. [Sinnemäki & Di Garbo](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:SinnemakiDiGarbo2018) ([2018](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:SinnemakiDiGarbo2018)) provide initial evidence substantiating this claim typologically. [Raviv et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:RavivEtAl2021) 's ([2021](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:RavivEtAl2021)) experimental study further show that community size in itself does not affect learnability of morphological complexity, but [Raviv et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:RavivEtAl2019) 's ([2019](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:RavivEtAl2019)) study suggest that large communities may create more systematic languages. In addition, community size seems to be in a complex relationship with social network structure and mechanisms of transmission within the network, as suggested by computer simulations on cumulative cultural evolution ([Cantor et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:CantorEtAl2021) [2021](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:CantorEtAl2021)).

However, there may be some room for considering population size as a meaningful factor on its own, too. Population size seems to affect the rate of language change in that large populations gain words more rapidly, while small populations lose words more rapidly ([Bromham et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:BromhamEtAl2015) [2015](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:BromhamEtAl2015); [Greenhill et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:GreenhillEtAl2018) [2018](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:GreenhillEtAl2018)).

In this questionnaire we collect data on the number of native speakers so that we can correlate it with other sociolinguistic factors, such as density of social networks (S6/7). Our purpose is to test, for instance, Trudgill's hypothesis that linguistic complexity is affected by several sociolinguistic factors in tandem, including community size, and social network density, as well as [Reali et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:RealiEtAl2018) 's ([2018](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:RealiEtAl2018)) simulation result that population size affects ease vs. difficulty of diffusion within populations.

## Goal

This question aims to collect data on the number of native speakers, much like the previous questions ([OD1](OD1.md)/[OD3](OD3.md)). This question more specifically asks about the *proportion* of native-like speakers, rather than absolute numbers of speakers.


## Definitions

- The term *native-like* *speakers* encompasses two types of people. First, it refers to those members of the language group who have learned the Focus Group language as the first language. Second, it refers to those members of the Focus Group who have learned the language since childhood and their competence in the language is comparable to first language learners.
- The term *non-native-like speakers* refers to speakers of the Focus Group language that have learned the language as an additional language but whose competence in the language is not as good as that of native-like speakers.


The scale is as follows:

- *Low proportion:* a small minority (roughly 20% or less) of all speakers are native-like speakers
- *Fairly low proportion:* a minority of all speakers (roughly 20–40%) are native-like speakers.
- *Intermediate proportion:* roughly half of all speakers (roughly 40–60%) are native-like speakers.
- *Fairly high proportion:* the majority of speakers (roughly 60–80%) are native like speakers
- *High proportion:* an overwhelming majority (roughly 80% or higher) of speakers are native-like speakers

## Examples

- Focus Group = Finnish, Neighbour Group = Swedish, contemporary situation:According to the 2018 census of Finland, there are 4,840,000 L1 users of Finnish in Finland, and 30,000 speakers of Tornedalen Finnish speakers in Sweden. The Ethnologue lists the ""total users in all countries"" as 5,114,040. The same entry identifies the number of L2 Finnish speakers as 656,000. The answer to this question would 656,000/5,114,040 = approx. 11%, which falls into Category 1: Low proportion.

## Theoretical & Empirical Support

Proportion of native-like vs. non-native-like speakers has been used in the typological literature as a proxy for contact effects on language structures, especially on morphological complexity (e.g. [Bentz & Winter](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:BentzWinter2013) [2013](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:BentzWinter2013); [Sinnemäki & Di Garbo](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:SinnemakiDiGarbo2018) [2018](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:SinnemakiDiGarbo2018); [Sinnemäki](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Sinnemaki2020) [2020](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Sinnemaki2020)). We are not so keen on using this proportion as a measure on its own, because it may be linked to various different explanatory factors (see [Bentz & Winter](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:BentzWinter2013) [2013](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:BentzWinter2013): 3–5; and references there). Instead we intend to assess whether this proportion correlates with any other sociolinguistic features in our questionnaire. This will help us assessing whether this proportion can really serve as a proxy for the degree of language contact and its effects on language structures, whether it serves as a proxy for something else or whether it serves as a proxy for nothing theoretically interesting.

> [!NOTE]
> In the questionnaire this question is stated as ""OG1: What is the population density within the area where the Focus Language is spoken?""

The scale of answers is the following:

- *Less than 2 persons per 10 sq. km*
- *2-4 persons per 10 sq. km*
- *5-19 persons per 10 sq. km*
- *20-99 persons per 10 sq. km*

Note that here the unit for geographical area is *10 square kilometres* (km^2) instead of *1 km^2*. For some minority language groups population density is smaller than one person per km^2, which is why we opted expressing population density in larger units. In the D-Place the unit is square mile (one square mile equals roughly 2.6 square kilometres).
## Goal

This question seeks information about population density.
## Definitions

Underlyingly this question requires data about the number of speakers/users of the Focus Language and the approximate size of the area where the Focus Language is used. Population density is then estimated by dividing population size by the geographical area: $d_{density} = {N_{population}}/{A_{area}}$. See feature OD1 for the Total number of native speakers; the geographical area was estimated by the respondents, but sometimes the density was accrued from available documents (see the Comments to the responses).

This population density translates to roughly 1-5 persons per 2.6 square kilometres, which falls into our Category 3: 5–19 persons per 10 square kilometres.
- The entry for [Gitxan society](https://d-place.org/society/WNAI6) (Gitxan, Tsimshian; United States of America) lists the population density as 5–25 persons per square mile. This population density translates to roughly 5-25 persons per 2.6 square kilometres, which falls into our Category 4: 20–99 persons per 10 square kilometres.
- The entry for [Palauans](https://d-place.org/society/SCCS111) (Palauan, Austronesian; Palau) lists the population density as 26–100 persons per square mile. This population density translates to roughly 26-100 persons per 2.6 square kilometres, which falls into Category 5: 100–399 persons per 10 square kilometres.


## Theoretical & Empirical Support

Language change is sometimes described as a process that involves two stages: the initial stage of innovation and the subsequent spread of the innovation within the language group. Research in sociolinguistics, historical linguistics, and language typology has suggested that social factors, population density among them, may affect both the degree of innovations as well as the spread of linguistic features.

Some evidence seems to suggest that population density may encourage innovations of different kinds so that the rate of language change may increase as population size, and thus also its density increase ([Bromham et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:bromham2015a) [2015](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:bromham2015a)). For instance, population density has been suggested as an important predictor of how many languages may be spoken in a region ([Pacheco Coelho et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:coelho2019a) [2019](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:coelho2019a)) and inversely, it may thus be a potential predictor of language endangerment as well ([Bromham et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:bromham2021a) [2021](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:bromham2021a)).

Population density may affect linguistic diversity either directly or indirectly. [Pacheco Coelho et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:coelho2019a) ([2019](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:coelho2019a)) tested the influence of several competing ecological factors on linguistic diversity and population density emerged as the strongest factor. Furthermore, most of the other ecological factors seemed to have a greater effect on population density than on linguistic diversity. What this means is that population density may have a direct effect on linguistic diversity, but it may also mediate the effect of other factors, such as ecological risk. For instance, if food production becomes more reliable in a region, it reduces ecological risk and may allow smaller cultural groups to be self-sufficient. These factors may allow greater population density but also greater cultural and linguistic diversity within the region (e.g., [Hua et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:hua2019a) [2019](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:hua2019a)).

On the other hand, population density is one of the factors that may have rather immediate consequences to social networks and thus to the way linguistic innovations spread in the language community (e.g., [Bowern](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:bowern2010a) [2010](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:bowern2010a): 667; see also [Fagyal et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:fagyal2010a) [2010](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:fagyal2010a)). Where populations are dense, social networks also tend to be dense and complex, being favorable to the local clustering of linguistic innovations. High population density may also favor stronger interpersonal contacts and such intense contacts tend to lead to faster spread of innovations ([Wolfram & Schilling-Estes](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:wolfram2003a) [2003](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:wolfram2003a)). This line of thinking goes back to [Bloomfield](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:bloomfield1933a) ([1933](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:bloomfield1933a)) and his ""principle of local density"". At best, population density could function as a measure for the degree of contact between two language populations.

However, population density alone may be an insufficient predictor of the intensity of contact. In his ""gravity model"", [Trudgill](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:trudgill1974a) ([1974](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:trudgill1974a)) proposed that population density should be treated together with the geographic distance between populations to explain dialect diffusion. Later work suggested even more factors were needed to better understand which factors may inhibit and speed up the spread of innovations (see e.g. the discussion in [Wolfram & Schilling-Estes](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:wolfram2003a) [2003](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:wolfram2003a)).

All in all, population density has been suggested as an important factor that may be related to both the rate of innovations and the speed of their diffusion across the language group. For further work (also by non-linguists) see for instance [Baxter](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:baxter2006a) ([2006](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:baxter2006a)), [Burridge](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:burridge2017a) ([2017](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:burridge2017a)), and [Burridge & Blaxter](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:burridge2021a) ([2021](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:burridge2021a)).

## Goal

This question seeks information about the occurrence of any societal upheaval or natural disaster that has impacted people's mobility. In other words, we are interested whether such abrupt causes may have influenced the Focus group's contact with the Neighbour group in any way.

## Possible Response

- Yes
- No

## Theoretical & Empirical Support

Famines, wars, natural disasters, or major societal upheavals usually impact people's mobility in significant ways when people leave their home regions in search for food or shelter. Disasters of this kind may result in loss of linguistic diversity owing to depopulation and to people migrating and shifting to another language. If the migrating people shift to another language, this may also lead to simplification of the successor language's grammar, as could be hypothesized when one language community absorbs a large number of newcomers who learn the language as a non-native language (e.g., [Trudgill](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Trudgill2011) [2011](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Trudgill2011)). At the least, significant mobility typically breaks social networks and may affect how linguistic variants diffuse in the population.

As an example, [Grünthal et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:gruenthal2022a) ([2022](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:gruenthal2022a): see Supplement S9 and references there) discuss the medieval Black Death in Europe. This bubonic plague pandemic had drastic societal effects because of the large-scale loss of lives. Undoubtedly, the pandemic had also significant effects on language ecologies across Europe. A number of researchers have discussed, for instance, whether the inflectional system of Norwegian may have simplified owing to the sociolinguistic causes of the pandemic (e.g., [Jahr](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:jahr1999a) [1999](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:jahr1999a); [Mæhlum](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:m2000a) [2000](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:m2000a); [Askedal](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:askedal2005a) [2005](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:askedal2005a)). Howerver, no systematic research has yet been done on the possible linguistic outcomes of the Black Death.

[Grünthal et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:gruenthal2022a) ([2022](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:gruenthal2022a): e.g. 498-500) further argue that the rapid spread of the Uralic people was caused by a catastrophic climate change 3800 to 4200 years ago. This event, known in the Earth sciences as the 4.2 ka event, led to global cooling, greater precipitation in northwest Eurasia, and drought in some continental interiors. These conditions seem to have led to greater opportunities for riverine hunter-fisherers (i.e. Uralic people) who spread rapidly West of Urals and created a large trade-network.

While societal upheaval or natural disaster may sometimes be the only contributing factor to large-scale mobility, often there is no single cause but several factors involved. For instance, the rapid spread of the Slavs in different parts of Europe may have been caused by two factors operating around the same time (see [Lindstedt and Salmela](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:lindstedt2020a) [2020](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:lindstedt2020a)). First, the Late Antique Little Ice Age in the 6th and 7th centuries cooled climate, probably as a result of volcanic eruptions in the early 6th century. This climate change caused farmers to migrate and seek more favorable conditions for agriculture elsewhere. Second, the Plague of Justinian in the 6th to 8th centuries resulted in the death of about 25-50 million people in the Byzantine Empire alone, causing the depopulation of farming communities across the Balkans and the ensuing spread of the Slavs there.

- Very high

## Goal

Here we wish to get a general assessment of language loyalty in the Focus Group. Language loyalty can be characterised by a variety of parameters, so here we ask you to make that assessment along parameters you believe are important and relevant for the community in question.
## Definitions

*Language loyalty:* A tendency to be loyal to one’s language, typically by expressing a desire to retain an identity that is expressed through the use of that language. High levels of language loyalty lead people to using and maintaining a language actively, “even in adverse conditions” ([González](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Gonzalez2008) [2008](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Gonzalez2008): 445).

- *Very low*, e.g. people do not consider it very important to speak “their language” and will speak other languages in many contexts. May express linguistic shame, denigrate their language.
- *Low*, e.g. people do not consider it particularly important to speak their language. May be self-deprecating about their language.
- *Neither low nor high*, e.g. people do not have particularly strong opinions about their language. The choice of what language to speak may be motivated by pragmatism, or not clearly motivated by anything.
- *High*, e.g. people consider it important. People prefer to speak “their language” in most contexts but will also speak other languages where appropriate.
- *Very high*, e.g. people consider it very important to speak “their language”. People choose to speak “their language” in the vast majority of contexts.
## Theoretical & Empirical Support

As per the definition, language loyalty is an aspect of language attitude that contributes to languages’ continued use social life. The term is typically used in context of minority languages within nation-state contexts (beginning with the seminal publication [Fishman](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Fishman1966) [1966](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Fishman1966)). As such, high levels of language loyalty are associated with the vitality of minority languages (indigenous languages, migrant heritage languages).

Language loyalty is partially related to concepts of language and identity, in that language loyalty and “linguistic acts of loyalty” ([Stanford](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Stanford2009) [2009a](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Stanford2009)) are kinds of “acts of identity” ([Le Page & Tabouret-Keller](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:LePageTabouret-Keller1985) [1985](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:LePageTabouret-Keller1985)). For example, [Stanford](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Stanford2009) ([2009a](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Stanford2009)) analyses the continued use of clan-indexing tonal patterns by Sui women as linguistic acts of loyalty to their patrilineal clan, despite these women marrying and residing with their husband’s on his patrilineal clan lands.

- No

## Goal

In this question we wish to know whether language is stated as some kind of emblem of group identity.


## Definitions

- *Relationships of descent*: A group based on emically defined ways of grouping people who share ancestry and kin. Publications may refer to these groups variously as clans, kinship groups, descent groups, lineage groups, house systems.
- *Race, ethnicity*: A difference based on perceived physical differences, often overlapping with perceived cultural and linguistic differences. Emic commentary on this category often mentions these perceived physical differences, along with identification of difference in some of the following: economic system, wealth, primary subsistence pattern, major staple crop, belief system
- *Local geographical or territorial group*: A group based on local geographical or territorial organization, such as a village, region, neighbourhood, or tribe, but not based on shared ancestry or kinship.
- *Macro-level (politico-)territorial group:* A macro-level group category that supersedes other levels of grouping, such as kin, and local community. The group as a collective has some kind of jurisdictional power, such as exerting punishment for transgressions, and the ability to declare warfare upon other politico-territorial groups.
- *Formal or informal relationships between non-kin*: Identities based on relationship ties rather than those of group membership. Such as alliances, sodality membership, ad-hoc relationships between families or individuals.

## Theoretical & Empirical Support

Language is often a marker of some form of identity. Speakers'/signers' linkage of language and identities may be strong, such as in numerous pre-colonial Australian Indigenous contexts ([Merlan](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Merlan1981) [1981](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Merlan1981)), parts of Melanesia ([Grace](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Grace1975) [1975](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Grace1975), [Laycock](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Laycock1982) [1982](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Laycock1982)), and in European Romanticism ([Bauman & Briggs](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:BaumanBriggs2000) [2000](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:BaumanBriggs2000)). The relationship between language and identity can also be secondary, or absent from speaker's conscious reporting (e.g. [Khanina](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Khanina2021) [2021](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Khanina2021) for northern Siberia). The ubiquitous relating between language and identity has led to investigations concerning the evolutionary functions of language as markers of identities ([Moya](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Moya2013) [2013](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Moya2013), c.f. [Moya and Henrich](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:MoyaHenrich2016) [2016](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:MoyaHenrich2016)).

The above types of identities were chosen for the questionnaire based on the numerous works recurrently showing the relevance of these categories to language variation and change. These particular social factors were identified for the Overview Questionnaire as they frequently appear as factors linking language and identity at gross level, rather than identities within a broadly construed language community. The reason may be because the relationship between identity and language variation is about a social group exercising agency and power (e.g. [Bucholtz and Hall](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:BucholtzHall2004) [2004](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:BucholtzHall2004): 371), and the identification of a group via language leads to perceived or real gains of socio(-political) agency and power.

- Macro (politico-)territorial group: language, ethnicity, and nationalism c.f. [Lytra](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Lytra2020) [2020](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Lytra2020); see [Gooskens and Kürschner](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:GooskensKurschner2009) [2009](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:GooskensKurschner2009) on effects of national borders on language change.
- Formal or informal relationships between non-kin:  c.f. [King](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:King2019) [2019](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:King2019) on communities of practice in variationism.

The connection between language and identity is thought to play a role in language variation and change in a number of ways:
- It may form a psychological boundary between languages, enforcing a linguistic boundary between linguistic codes in speakers' minds. This may, for example, maintain the separation of parts of linguistic codes in multilingual/language contact situations ([François](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Francois2012) [2012](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Francois2012)), and even contribute to language differentiation ([Irvine and Gal](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:IrvineGal2000) [2000](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:IrvineGal2000)).
- It may enforce norms within a language ([Milroy & Margrain](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:MilroyMargrain1980) [1980](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:MilroyMargrain1980)) and may hinder language shift speakers/signers assume a positive self identity that is tied to language ([Giles & Johnson](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:GilesJohnson1987) [1987](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:GilesJohnson1987)).

The exact role of identity as a causal factor in language change is debated. [Labov](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Labov2001) ([2001](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Labov2001)) expresses skepticism that the concept of local identity motivates language change (p.191). [Mufwene](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Mufwene2001) ([2001](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Mufwene2001)) suggests that speakers of creoles do not create languages but that creoles emerge from linguistic production without intention. [Trudgill](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Trudgill2008) ([2008](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Trudgill2008)) argues that European colonial varieties such as Brazillian Portugese and New Zealand English emerge from dialect mixture rather than from a desire to mark out a new national identity.

The causal role of identity in language variation and change is perhaps causal only under specific circumstances. The relationship between language and identity is fluid, and the causal effect of identity on language variation and change will vary by place and time.

Authors: [](ContributionTable?__template__=property.md&property=contributor#cldf:OI3)

- *yes*
- *no*
## Goal

In this question we wish to know whether the Focus Group language has a clearly codified standard variety or not.


## Definitions

The term *codified* refers to rules and standards enshrined in orthography and in an existing corpus, such as holy texts or other important literature.


## Examples

- The creation of a codified standard variety of French began in earnest in the 16th century. As Latin was slowly being displaced as the main language of reading and writing, “King’s French”, e.g. Parisian French gained prestige. In the period from mid-16th century to the early 17th century, multiple dictionaries, glossaries, and prescriptive grammars were published, and L’Académie Française was established in 1635. In post-Revolutionary France, these works were used as the basis for propagating the standard variety all over the country, at the expense of dialects. Once widespread non-standard languages and dialects have until quite recently been treated with hostility. ([Lodge](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Lodge1993) [1993](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Lodge1993).)
- In Spain, the spread of Castilian as the standard variety is linked to the Reconquista of the Iberian peninsula, which lead to the northern dialect being spread to the south. The codification of Castilian Spanish began in the 13th century and was further solidified by the publication of e.g. prescriptive grammars in the turn of the 16th century. Eventually Castilian became the main language of administration, science, and literature even in Galicia and Catalan-speaking areas and was almost exclusively the language of education. Catalan, and to some extent also Galician, have regained their status as languages used in e.g. literature only from the mid-19th century onwards. ([Penny](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Penny2002) [2002](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Penny2002); [Burke](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Burke2004) [2004](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Burke2004).)
- The earliest written Finnish in the 16th century was heavily based on western dialects of Finnish and greatly influenced by Swedish, Latin, and to some extent, German orthography. In the 19th century, there were rigorous efforts to purify standard Finnish from Swedish influences, including attempts to remove the grapheme <d> from the written language. During the 19th century,  several features of eastern dialects were accepted in the standard variety, and modern standard Finnish is a compromise between east and west dialectal features. ([Nordlund](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Nordlund2012) [2012](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Nordlund2012).)

## Theoretical & Empirical Support

We are interested in standard varieties as they seem to have an effect of flattening community internal linguistic variation. As [Lüpke](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Lupke2011) ([2011](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Lupke2011)) notes, written uses of language ""presupposes its standardization"" which may accelerate cultural change and loss of ""the phatic values of the vernacular"" (p.313) resulting in a gradual decline of local languages in what was once a multilingual language ecology. [Broucier](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Broucier2014) ([2014](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Broucier2014)) demonstrates Standardisation via orthography can lead to speakers adopting utilitarian approaches to language acquisition and use, thereby harming language revitalisation efforts in some communities. Standardisation by definition means making things similar across parameters, and there is ample evidence from across the world where standardisation via orthography results in the loss of linguistic diversity.

## Goal

With this question we ask about Focus Group speakers' attitudes towards linguistic transfer from Neighbour Group. However, this attitude may differ from Focus Group speakers' attitudes towards linguistic transfer in general (that is, from any other language) - a question we ask in [OI7](OI7.md) below.


## Definitions

- *Very negative:* transfer of linguistic items is highly stigmatised, frowned upon, or thought threatening to linguistic purity, for instance.
- *Neither positive nor negative:* neutral attitude towards linguistic transfer: no clear opinion, indifference.
- *Very positive:* linguistic transfer is highly valued, for instance, when young people borrow expressions from a prestige language.

## Theoretical & Empirical Support

Language attitudes play an important role in people's linguistic behaviour in language contact situations. If a group's attitude is indifferent or even favours linguistic transfer, this can lead to extensive lexical and even grammatical borrowing. For instance, [Law](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Law2014) 's ([2014](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Law2014); see also the discussion in [Rodríguez-Ordóñez](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Rodriguez-Ordonez2019) [2019](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Rodriguez-Ordonez2019)) studies of the related Mayan languages in Guatemala, Mexico, and Belize suggested that the contact situations had resulted in significant convergence, restructuring, and even borrowing of whole morphological paradigms under language contact. The attitude of Maya Lowlanders was perhaps not outright positive towards transfer but there was sufficient indifference for extensive linguistic transfer to take place. On the other hand, the vibrant social contact between Uruguyan Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese in the border communities of Brazil and Uruguay has not led to extensive linguistic transfer because of the prevailing linguistic ideology of standard national languages (e.g. [Carvalho](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Carvalho2014) [2014](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Carvalho2014); see also the related discussion in [Rodríguez-Ordóñez](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Rodriguez-Ordonez2019) [2019](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Rodriguez-Ordonez2019)). The result is a stable multilingual community where the linguistic codes are kept quite strictly separate. The attitude towards linguistic transfer is thus viewed negatively.

If the attitudes are strong, it appears that bilingual speakers are capable of keeping lexicon and phonology quite distinct in the languages in contact. Speakers are generally less aware of morphosyntax and therefore it is possible that even strong language attitudes cannot keep grammar distinct in the languages in contact.

## Goal

With this question we ask Focus Group speakers' attitudes towards linguistic transfer in general, from any other language than Neighbour Group. The reason for this is that this attitude may differ from Focus Group speakers' attitudes towards linguistic transfer from the Neighbour Group - a question we ask in OI6. These differences in attitudes have not often been central in sociolinguistic research, which makes it an interesting question in itself.


## Definitions

- *Very negative:* transfer of linguistic items is highly stigmatised, frowned upon, or thought threatening to linguistic purity, for instance.
- *Neither positive nor negative:* neutral attitude towards linguistic transfer, no clear opinion, indifference
- *Very positive:* linguistic transfer is highly valued, for instance, when young people borrow expressions from a prestige language.

## Theoretical & Empirical Support

Language attitudes play an important role in people's linguistic behaviour in language contact situations. If a group's attitude is indifferent or even favors linguistic transfer, this can lead to extensive lexical and even grammatical borrowing. For instance, [Law](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Law2014) 's ([2014](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Law2014); see also the discussion in [Rodríguez-Ordóñez](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Rodriguez-Ordonez2019) [2019](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Rodriguez-Ordonez2019)) studies of the related Mayan languages in Guatemala, Mexico, and Belize suggested that the contact situations had resulted in significant convergence, restructuring, and even borrowing of whole morphological paradigms under language contact.

- Very insignificant
- Insignificant
- Neither insignificant nor significant
- Significant
- Very significant

## Goal

This question asks whether language is identified by speakers as emblematic of some kind of group identity.


## Definitions

- *Very insignificant:* language is not at all significant to group identity. The group's identity may be tied to some other factors, such as land or ethnicity.
- *Very significant:* language forms a very significant part of group identity. Language may be the strongest indicator of group identity, and threats to language are considered threats to the survival of the whole group.

## Theoretical & Empirical Support

Language is often an important part of group identity. Language identity plays an important role in linguistic choices and it may also affect other linguistic behavior (e.g. [Joseph](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Joseph2004) [2004](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Joseph2004); [Taylor-Leech](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Taylor-Leech2012) [2012](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Taylor-Leech2012); among many others). When language plays a significant role for group identity, it is transmitted to children when emigrating to another location or when education and better job opportunities are available in another language, for instance. If language is not important for group identity, this may affect language choice, such as not transmitting the heritage language to children or shifting to majority language that offers better possibilities for work and education. Especially in cases of language endangerment, successful revitalization efforts seem to require that language identity is strong so that the language will continue to be transmitted to children instead of the group shifting to another language.

[Law](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Law2014) 's ([2014](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Law2014)) studies of the related Mayan languages in Guatemala, Mexico, and Belize suggested that for Maya Lowlanders language did not form a significant part of their group identity and therefore extensive linguistic borrowing was possible. On the other hand, the vibrant social contact between Uruguyan Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese in the border communities of Brazil and Uruguay has not led to extensive linguistic transfer because of the prevailing linguistic ideology of standard national languages (e.g. [Carvalho](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Carvalho2014) [2014](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Carvalho2014); see also the related discussion in [Rodríguez-Ordóñez](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Rodriguez-Ordonez2019) [2019](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Rodriguez-Ordonez2019)). The result is rather a stable multilingual community where the linguistic codes are kept quite strictly separate. In these communities language thus forms a very significant part of group identity with major influence on linguistic behaviour.

- Very negative
- Negative
- Neither positive nor negative

- Very positive

## Goal

The purpose of this question is to gain general characterisation of the Focus Group speakers' attitudes to language internal variation.

Positive attitudes towards lectal differences may have different outcomes. One possibility is that positive attitude towards lectal differences creates openness towards linguistic transfer from another language. But because positive attitudes towards lectal differences may also be closely connected with group identity, it is possible that they will instead create opposition towards linguistic transfer from other languages. Because these issues are unclear it is relevant to try answering these questions to the extent possible.


## Definitions

The term *lectal differences* refers here to different accents, dialects, and sociolects.

The scale of answers is as follows:
- *Very negative*: lectal differences are frowned upon and there may be discrimination or prejudice against speakers of certain lects.
- *Neither positive nor negative*: neutral attitude towards lectal differences, no clear opinion, indifference.
- *Very positive*: lectal differences are appreciated and highly valued perhaps as emblems of local identity.


## Theoretical & Empirical Support

Language attitudes may play an important role in people's linguistic behaviour both in terms of language change at a general level and in terms of language contact situations. With question BA we have asked about the Focus Group people's overall attitude towards the Neighbour Group people in different social domains. With question OI6 we have asked about the Focus Group speakers' attitudes towards linguistic transfers from the Neighbour Group. Both these questions probe language attitudes in situations of language contact. With this question OI9, we ask about the Focus group people's attitude toward lectal differences within the Focus group. This question is thus not directly asking about attitudes towards any contact-related phenomenon.

However, language attitudes towards group-internal lectal differences may also play an important role in people's linguistic behaviour in situations of dialect or language contact. For instance, positive attitude towards language-internal variation, such as lectal differences, may suggest greater openness towards linguistic transfer from other languages as well. For instance, the Uto-Aztecan Western Mono people valorize language-internal diversity and this attitude is part of a more general linguistic ideology which also puts value on multilingualism. This ideology has also resulted in widespread borrowing ([Kroskrity](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:kroskrity_2023) [2023](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:kroskrity_2023)). In contrast, the Tewa people (Kiowa-Tanoan) have a linguistic ideology that could be characterized as indigenous purism: the Tewa language plays a crucial role for their group identity whereby there is also a strong push to linguistic orthodoxy and standardization ([Kroskrity](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:kroskrity_2023) [2023](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:kroskrity_2023)). As a result, The Tewa language has only a few borrowings from other languages. Opposite trends are possible as well, such as a positive attitude towards lectal differences being a strong factor for group identity, which would might create opposition towards linguistic transfer from other languages.

OL1,OL1: What is the approximate rate of formal literacy in the Focus Group community?,"# [](ContributionTable?__template__=property.md&property=name#cldf:OL1)

Authors: [](ContributionTable?__template__=property.md&property=contributor#cldf:OL1)
> [!NOTE]
> In the questionnaire this question is formulated as: ""What is the approximate rate of formal literacy in the Focus language speaking community?""

- Low
- Fairly low
- Intermediate
- Fairly high
- High
## Goal

The purpose of this question is to get an approximate sense of how prevalent literacy is for the total population of the Focus Group language speakers.


## Definitions

Literacy can be grouped into formal and functional literacy.
- *Formal literacy* refers minimally to knowing the orthography and being able to read simple texts familiar to the reader but potentially still with problems in understanding.
- *Functional literacy* refers to the ability of reading and understanding a range of different kinds of texts that are new to the reader, and to the ability of writing.
Please answer from the perspective of *formal literacy.*
The scale is as follows:

- *Low:* a small minority of members of the language community (roughly 20% or less) are literate.

- *Fairly low:* a minority of members in the language community (roughly 20–40%) are literate.

- *Intermediate:* roughly half of all members in the language community (roughly 40–60%) are literate.

- *Fairly high:* the majority of members in the language community (roughly 60–80%) are literate.

- *High:* an overwhelming majority of members in the language community (roughly 80% or more) are literate.


## Theoretical & Empirical Support

High rate of literacy is a fairly recent development in human history. Before mass education in modern societies, high rates of formal literacy across social groups occurred mostly in the Nordic countries, where the dominant Lutheran societal norms required people to learn to read (e.g., [Sinnemäki et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:sinnemaeki2019a) [2019](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:sinnemaeki2019a)). High rates in writing skills have been even less common before modern times. Some exceptions to these trends do exist, but they tend to be limited to certain social groups, such as to soldiers of the ancient Roman empire (e.g., [Speidel](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:speidel2018a) [2018](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:speidel2018a); [Tomlin](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:tomlin2018a) [2018](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:tomlin2018a)).

There is some evidence suggesting that the ability to read and write may affect individual's cognitive processing. For instance, research in cognitive and experimental psychology suggests that acquiring the association between a phoneme and a corresponding visual symbol alters the way that oral second language is processed at least in tasks that demand awareness of linguistic segments ([Tarone](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:tarone2010a) [2010](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:tarone2010a)). Illiterate adults appear to be strong in tasks related to syllable segmentation and rhyming, but weaker than literate adults in tasks related to phonemic segmentation (e.g., [Tarone & Bigelow](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:tarone2005a) [2005](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:tarone2005a)).

Literacy may also affect the units of language processing in both children and adults and the subsequent learning of particular grammatical patterns (see e.g. [Havron](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:havron2017a) [2017](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:havron2017a)). Learning from multiword units benefits both adults and children in learning, for instance, grammatical agreement, because agreement domains stretch over multiple words. However, children seem to prefer to learn from larger linguistic units compared to adults (e.g., [Havron & Arnon](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:havron2021a) [2021](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:havron2021a)). As a result, children's learning outcomes seem to be better in learning grammatical agreement compared to noun learning, which focuses on learning single words. This difference in multiword vs. single word learning disappears when children learn to read and focus more on single written words separated from one another via spaces.

(Answer Yes/No to the following)
- Group associated with profession or wealth, such as class and caste: key criteria here are hierarchy and associated with profession. Example: Feudal European divisions, such as nobility and serf.
- Magico-religiously sanctioned groups, such as religious denomination: a group whose existence and powers are justified based on spiritual/divine/non-human foundations and/or creed. Examples: the clergy, Hindu caste system, ceremonial groups, Sunni and Shia muslims.

- Races, ethnicities, or other similar groupings: a difference based on perceived cultural and linguistic differences. Choose ""yes"" only if emic commentary on this category mentions perceived physical differences along with identification of difference in one of the following: economic system, wealth, primary subsistence pattern, major staple corn, belief system.
- Age cohorts or life stages: social category related to life stages, such as pre-initate, teenage-hood, unmarried, community elder. We are not asking if there is evidence of age-conditioned variation (i.e. change in progress) but if there are emically salient cohorts which arguably form some kind of community of practice.
- Sex or genders: choose ""yes"" only if one's assigned gender severely restricts access to literacy. For example, if women are excluded from learning to read and write, choose ""yes"".
- Other

## Goal

This question seeks to identify social categories that likely form distinct communities of practice in terms of literacy. Put another way, we are interested in identifying emically relevant social groups which are likely to play a role in linguistic variation related to access to literacy. Here, we use the term communities of practice (CoP) to broadly mean a group of people connected to one another by partaking in similar activities and/or states of being. By doing so we acknowledge the socially constructed and culturally specific nature of social categories, such as gender and ethnicity.

We are interested in identifying salient community-internal social categories in order to identify possible subnetworks of people within a speech community. It is plausible that contact situations affect these subnetworks differently instead of contact situations and contact processes spanning a single community homogeneously. For example, contact between Finnish speakers and speakers of ""L1 varieties of English"" in the domain of work is likely to be concentrated towards white collar and other upper-middle socio-economic networks, while contact between Finnish speakers and Kurdish speakers would cover a different demographic.This complexity of social network means there are various pathways through which linguistic innovations related to access to literacy can diffuse through the wider speech community (or not). Emically salient social categories are also often good candidates for identifying the social patterning of linguistic variation within a community. By identifying possible subnetworks, we may get a better picture of how linguistic consequences of contact may or may not have diffused through to the wider speech community.

Ideally we would want respondents to identify those social categories that are known or thought to affect linguistic production related to literacy (i.e. socially conditioned linguistic variation related to access to literacy). However since it is unlikely that such data are available for many communities, we are going to make an evidence based assumption that the mere emic identification of such social categories makes it likely that linguistic variation and differentiation related to literacy would occur along these lines.

We have a priori chosen the social categories in the possible response with the understanding that these social categories have been found to relate to linguistic variation in some way. We assume these social cateogries may be relevant in relation to linguistic variation related to access to literacy as well. We do not know as a field whether these linguistic consequences are markedly different across these different social categories (i.e. that the social conditioning of race begets markedly different linguistic change outcomes compared to the social conditioning of religion affiliation), but we would not assume this to be the case. These social categories would manifest in locally specific ways, and it would be those broader social and cultural contexts that would probably shape the trajectory of linguistic change and diffusion of change within the community anyway.

## Definitions and Examples

This question asks whether there are any restrictions in access to literacy in terms of social categories. The question has seven binary subquestions, each question related to a specific group/social category.

The following groups are identified:
- *Group associated with profession or wealth, such as class and caste*: key criteria here are *hierarchy* and *associated with profession*. Example: Feudal European divisions, such as nobility and serf.
- *Magico-religiously sanctioned groups, such as religious denomination*: a group whose existence and powers are justified based on spiritual/divine/non-human foundations and/or creed. Examples: the clergy, Hindu caste system, ceremonial groups, Sunni and Shia muslims.
- *Descent groups, such as clan, house, lineage group, kinship group*: a group based on emically defined ways of grouping people who share ancestry and kin.
- *Races, ethnicities, or other similar groupings*: a difference based on perceived cultural and linguistic differences. Choose ""yes"" only if emic commentary on this category mentions perceived physical differences *along with* identification of difference in one of the following: economic system, wealth, primary subsistence pattern, major staple corn, belief system.
- *Age cohorts or life stages*: social category related to life stages, such as pre-initate, teenage-hood, unmarried, community elder. We are not asking if there is evidence of age-conditioned variation (i.e. change in progress) but if there are emically salient cohorts which arguably form some kind of community of practice.
- *Sex or genders*: choose ""yes"" only if one's assigned gender severly restricts access to literacy. For example, if women are excluded from learning to read and write, choose ""yes"".
- Other communmity of practice.

- *Yes, in a non-standardised way*
- *Yes, in a standardised way*
- *No, the Focus Group language is not written*
## Goal

Asking about orthography gives us a sense of degrees in literacy. Asking about standardised orthography gives us a sense of how centralised the society is.


## Definitions

*Orthography* refers to any writing system.

The scale is as follows:
- *Yes, in a non-standardised way:* language is written but there is no standardised way of writing and there is a lot of variation in how people use orthography.
- *Yes, in a standardised way:* language is written and there is a standardised way of writing available, but there may still be some variation in to what extent people write in a standardised way.
- *No, the Focus Group language is not written:* language is not written at all, or it may be written but writing in the Focus Group language is very rare and sporadic.

## Examples

The following examples are from *The Ethnologue* ([Eberhard et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:eberhard2023a) [2023](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:eberhard2023a)) unless otherwise specified.
- Rotokas speakers (North Bougainville, Papua New Guinea) use Latin script; it seems to have a standard ortography. The literacy rate of both L1 and L2 Rotokas speakers is 50–75%.
- North Saami speakers (Uralic; Norway, Sweden, Finland) use Latin script. A spelling reform in 1979 resulted in a ""pan-Scandinavian"" standard orthography, meaning that the language is to be spelled the same way irrespective of the state where it is written ([Östman](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:oestman2011a) [2011](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:oestman2011a): 367). The Ethnologue lists the literacy rate of L1 North Saami speakers as 30–60% and L2 speakers as 75–100%.
- Huichol speakers (Uto-Aztecan; Mexico) use Latin script; it appears to have a standard ortography.The literacy rate of L1 Huichol speakers is 5–10% and that of L2 speakers 5–15%.
- Halh Mongolian speakers (Mongolic; Mongolia, Russian Federation) use both Cyrillic and Mongolian script; a standard ortography is in use. Mongolian script was used prior to 1941 and again since the 1990s. According to The Ethnologue, also Phags-pa script and Tibetan script were previously in use.
- Lao speakers (Kra-Dai; Laos) use the standard Lao script. The literacy rate of L1 speakers is 30–60% and that of L2 speakers 50–75%.
- Gujari speakers (Indo-European; India, Pakistan, Afghanistan) use primarily the Nastaliq variant of Arabic script. Also Devanagari script is used and there are plans for future development of using Devanagari to write the language. All in all, ortography seems to be used but in a non-standard way, although attempts at standardizing have been underway (see [Losey](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:losey2002a) [2002](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:losey2002a)). The literacy rate of L2 speakers is 5–15%, but no figures are reported for L1 speakers. It appears that literacy rate of L1 speakers is fairly low: even in villages with education (which is unusual), fewer than half of the males and hardly any females had received any schooling (see [Losey](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:losey2002a) [2002](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:losey2002a): 6-7 and references there).
- Adang speakers (Timor-Alor-Pantar; Indonesia) do not have a standard orthography. Children seem to be mostly educated in Indonesian ([Haan](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:haan2001a) [2001](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:haan2001a); [Hamilton et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:hamilton2013a) [2013](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:hamilton2013a): 18). Literacy rate appears low but no figures are available.


## Theoretical & Empirical Support

This feature OL3 asks about the use of ortography. Asking about orthography serves different functions here. First, it is an alternative way of getting a sense of the degree in literacy. It is thus related to feature OL1, which asks directly about the rate of literacy. If an orthography is used for writing the language but not in a standardized way, this suggests at least some degree of literacy in that language. If standardised orthography is used for writing a language, this may also suggest a higher degree in literacy, although this is not necessarily always the case.

Second, asking about standard versus non-standard orthography may give a sense of how centralized and institutionalized language development is in the community. Standardization is a process that generally takes place in multilingual or multidialectal situations and it tends to reflect centralized and institutionalized practices of language development and planning. Through language planning, states govern the language policies and practices of their citizens. This usually involves status planning and acquisition planning ([Wright](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:wright_2012) [2012](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:wright_2012)), which affect relationships between languages in multilingual situations, or in the minimum. Corpus planning may further draw awareness to contact-induced features, affecting language use in practice. If there is no standardised orthography for writing a language, it is likely that there is no centralized and institutionalized language planning efforts in the community, or the level of their social acceptance may not be high. If standardised orthography exists for writing a language, this may also suggests that there is institutionalized language development in the community, and may as well give a sense of how centralised the society is.

Third, the presence of standardized vs. non-standardized orthography may also be related to the dominating language ideology, and tie back to how centralized the society is. For instance, the Uto-Aztecan Western Mono community values internal diversity to the extent that variation is harnessed as a signal of family differences ([Kroskrity](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:kroskrity_2023) [2023](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:kroskrity_2023): 278). The communities are egalitarian, as is typical in small-scale multilingual societies. When the first language development project started in the 1982, all members of the Mono community were literate in English and many wrote in Mono although there was no shared tradition of writing in Mono ([Kroskrity](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:kroskrity_2023) [2023](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:kroskrity_2023): 286-291). The Mono have currently no standardized orthography and this may be seen as a reflection of their language ideology. The situation is very different in Tewa (Kiowa-Tanoan), whose language ideology could be characterized as indigeneous purism and whose multilingualism is not egalitarian but rather chartered, meaning that languages have specialized roles ([Kroskrity](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:kroskrity_2023) [2023](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:kroskrity_2023): 291-295). Under these circumstances, the Tewa have selected a committee that has developed language materials and standard orthography, reflecting thus a more centralized and institutionalized approach to language development compared to the Mono.

## Goal

The purpose of this question is to get a loose characterisation of the political complexity of the Focus Group society.


## Definitions

- The term *jurisdictional hierarchy* refers to a rank with jurisdictional authority, such as the ability to punish transgressors.
- The term *local community* refers to the closest social circle to the household environment, but outside the realm of family and kin, who typically reside together in face-to-face association.


This question and possible answers are adapted from question EA003 in the Ethnographic Atlas ([Murdock et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:MurdockEtAl2023) [2023](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:MurdockEtAl2023)) that is available in D-Place ([Kirby et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:KirbyEtAl2016) [2016](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:KirbyEtAl2016); [Kirby et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:KirbyEtAl2018a) [2018](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:KirbyEtAl2018a); see https://d-place.org/parameters/EA033#1/30/153)

- *No levels:* no political authority beyond community

- *One level:* for example, described as petty chiefdoms.

- *Two levels:* for example, described as large chiefdoms. Often has some centralised structures.

- *Three levels:* for example, described as states. Often has some centralised structures.

- *Four levels:* for example, described as large states. Often has some centralised structures.
This variable attempts to characterise the vertical political structure within a society at a level larger than the local community. We take the same definition of local community we use in the domains questionnaire: closest to the household environment, but outside the realm of family and kin, and who typically reside together in face-to-face association.” (borrowed partially from [Murdock et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:MurdockEtAl1945) [1945](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:MurdockEtAl1945)) Note that this variable is unconcerned with the relationships between distinct societies, nor does it track the details of political structure within the local community.
The notion of a “language community” and ""society"" often correspond (as noted by Skirgård 2021:51), so for the purposes of this questionnaire we take the response to this question as loosely representative of the Focus Group as a whole.

## Theoretical Support

Jurisdictional hierarchy used in studies of cultural evolution as measures of state centralisation and development (c.f. [Giuliano & Nunn](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:GiulianoNunn2018a) [2018](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:GiulianoNunn2018a)). [Currie & Mace](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:CurrieMace2009) ([2009](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:CurrieMace2009)) for example found political complexity and type of subsistence strategy to be the best predictors to explain the geographic distribution of languages, and conclude that “more complex societies” may be favoured in process of cultural group selection.
The motivation behind the interest in political complexity is based on observations that human history has seen the development and increase of complex societies through human history (CHECK . Given this, we may surmise that when language contact occurs between societies/language communities of differing complexities, we are more likely to see phenomena that resembles language shift.
Scales of political complexity may in fact be proxies for social network cohesion ([Skirgård](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Skirgard2021) [2021](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Skirgard2021): 53; c.f.

## Theoretical Support

Political complexity is widely used in studies of cultural evolution ([Giuliano & Nunn](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:GiulianoNunn2018) [2018](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:GiulianoNunn2018)).

The motivation behind the interest in political complexity is based on observations that human history has seen the absorption of less complex societies by more complex ones (e.g. as stated in World Systems Theory, XXX). Given this, we may surmise that when language contact occurs between societies/language communities of differing complexities, we are more likely to see phenomena that resembles language shift.

Note it has also been noted that these scales of political complexity may also in fact be proxies for social network cohesion ([Skirgård](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Skirgard2021) [2021](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Skirgard2021): 53; c.f.

## Goal

Here we are asking specifically about mobility and sedentism as it pertains to subsistence. The question and answers relate to the scholarly interests in hunter-gather societies, pastoral nomadic societies, and other such groups.


## Definitions

- *Sedentary:* A group is completely sedentary or group moves into and out of a central location that is maintained for more than one year.
- *Mobile*: A group is mobile and moves the entire population from camp to camp as they go about the subsistence round.
- *Mixed:* Group is mobile for at least half the year, and are otherwise sedentary at designated locations.

Variable B009 can be found in D-Place ([Kirby et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:KirbyEtAl2016) [2016](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:KirbyEtAl2016); [Kirby et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:KirbyEtAl2018b) [2018](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:KirbyEtAl2018b); see https://d-place.org/parameters/B009#1/29/169).


## Examples

- Mobile: The entry for Tenino society (Tenino, Saptian; United States of America) in D-Place categorises the society as mobile. The local groups of Tenino each occupy two villages, one of which is inhabited during winter months, while the other is occupied during warmer months and located near the Columbia River or its tributaries, enabling fishing activities during summer ([Murdock](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Murdock1980) [1980](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Murdock1980): 129).
- Sedentary: The entry for Palawan Batak society (Batak, Austronesian; Philippines) in D-Place categorises the society as sedentary. The main forms of subsistence are collection of forest and riverine foods and upland rice cultivation, and Batak households tend to permanently habit a particular river and its watershed ([Eder](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Eder1978) [1978](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Eder1978): 57–58).
- Mixed: The subsistence pattern of the Twana society (Twana, Salishan; United States of America) can be best described as mixed. The Twana spend the winters in permanent villages until early spring, when the villagers disperse into smaller groups spending six to eight months in semi-nomadic activities, including fishing, hunting, and gathering. ([Schalk](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Schalk1978) [1978](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Schalk1978): 111–112, quoting [Elmendorf](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Elmendorf1960) [1960](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Elmendorf1960).)


## Theoretical Support

The consequences of nomadism on linguistic structure appear related to the spread of languages. For example the mobile nomads of Eurasia were crucial in the spread of the Turkic languages ([Yunusbayev et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:YunusbayevEtAl2015) [2015](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:YunusbayevEtAl2015)) at different points in time. The deep and continued relationship between nomads and their sedentary neighbours is well attested (see [Khazanov](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Khazanov2001) [2001](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Khazanov2001)), so one would expect this relational crux to be a point of interest for contact linguists.

Theoretically, nomadism may have consequences on linguistic structures due to it's social organisation. As has been argued for hunter-gatherers and their linguistic structures, the gross social organisation and interactional patterns of non-agriculturalists may have consequences for linguistic behaviours and long-term linguistic change (though see [Bickel and Nichols](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:BickelNichols2020) [2020](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:BickelNichols2020) for suggestion that are no structural differences between hunter-gatherer languages and sedentary languages). To the best of our knowledge, there have been no specific studies investigating the relationship between nomadism and linguistic structure, or language contact outcomes.

The purpose of this question is to broadly characterise the dominant form of subsistence of Focus Group society.


## Definitions

- *Hunter-gatherer:* Dependence on the gathering of wild plants, and land fauna relative to other subsistence activities.
- *Fishing:* Dependence on fishing, including shellfishing and the pursuit of large aquatic animals, relative to other subsistence activities.
- *Animal husbandry:* Dependence on animal husbandry, relative to other subsistence activities.
- *Agricultural, casual:* Dependence on low-intensity agriculture. Slight or sporadic cultivation of food or other plants incidental to a primary dependence upon other subsistence practices
- *Agricultural, shifting:* Dependence on semi-intensive agriculture. New fields are cleared up to every few years, cultivated for a few years, and then allowed to revert to forest or brush for a long fallow period
- *Agricultural, permanent:* Dependence on intensive agriculture. Permanent fields utilising technologies such as fertilisation and irrigation.
- *Highly Mixed:* A near-equal distribution of subsistence patterns


The categories are adapted from the variables EA001, EA002, EA003, EA004, and EA028 in the Ethnographic Atlas ([Gray](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Gray1999) [1999](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Gray1999); [Murdock et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:MurdockEtAl1999) [1999](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:MurdockEtAl1999)). All variables are available at D-Place (https://d-place.org/; [Kirby et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:KirbyEtAl2016) [2016](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:KirbyEtAl2016); 2018b). The category of *Agricultural, permanent* includes both “Intensive” and “Intensive irrigated” categories of EA028.


## Examples

- Hunter-gatherer: The entry for Chamacoco society (Chamacoco, Zamucoan; Paraguay) in D-Place lists subsistence as 56–65% gathering and 36–45% hunting.
- Fishing: The entry for Manus society (Titan, Austronesian; Papua New Guinea) in D-Place lists subsistence as 86–100% fishing.
- Animal husbandry: The entry for Midobi society (Midob, Nubian; Sudan) in D-Place lists subsistence as 86-100% animal husbandry.
- Agricultural, Casual: The entry for Yakut (Sakha, Turkic; Russia) in D-Place lists subsistence as casual agriculture, with animal husbandry, fishing, hunting, and gathering accounting for the rest of the subsistence pattern.
- Agricultural, Shifting: The entry for Bribri society (Bribri, Chibchan; Panama) in D-Place as lists subsistence as dominantly shifting agriculture, with fishing, gathering, and hunting accounting for the rest of the subsistence pattern.
- Agricultural, Permanent: The entry for Catawba society (Catawba, Siouan; United States of America) in D-Place lists subsistence as 66–75% intensive agriculture.
- Highly mixed: The entry for Selkup society (Selkup, Uralic; Russia) in D-Place lists subsistence as 36–45% animal husbandry, and 36–45% as fishing.

## Theoretical & Empirical Support

Subsistence patterns have at times been treated as representative of certain kinds of mobility patterns, which have consequences for interactions on many fronts. For example, food production strategies of subsistence such as agriculture, are able to sustain higher density populations. On the other hand, hunter-gatherers and pastoralists need to travel wider distances to support their substance patterns (). The hypothesis that peoples, and languages, spread out from an agricultural heartland due to the uptake of agricultural practices is epitomised in the farming dispersal hypothesis (summary in [Bellwood](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Bellwood2005) [2005](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Bellwood2005)). While there are critiques concerning conceptualisations found within this hypothesis (e.g. [Janowski](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Janowski2007) [2007](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Janowski2007)), we have nonetheless decided to follow the tradition of macro-areal studies by investigating subsistence pattern as a variable.

Other suggestions in the literature link subsistence patterns with behavioural characteristics. It has been suggested that adults in “low food accumulation” societies (hunter-gatherers, foragers) tend to be “individualistic, assertive, and venturesome” compared to adults of “high food accumulation societies” ([Berry](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Berry1967) [1967](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Berry1967); [Diamond](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Diamond1997) [1997](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Diamond1997)). Rice-growing societies of China were found to be more collectivistic than wheat-growing ones ([Talhelm et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:TalhelmEtAl2014) [2014](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:TalhelmEtAl2014), however see [Roberts](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Roberts2015) [2015](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Roberts2015) for caution in accepting Talhelm et al.’s results). If there are indeed behavioural characteristics associated with subsistence patterns, we may find some evidence that links subsistence patterns with linguistic adaptation.

## Goal

Answers to this question will help to better characterise the large-scale demographic data collected at the beginning of the questionnaire.


## Definitions

*Community at the local level* refers to residential communities, such as hamlets, villages, and towns, and not to networks of social interaction. However, it gives us a population index that is closer to social networks than to the size of the total population.

The scale is as follows:

- Fewer than 50 persons
- From 50 to 99 persons
- From 100 to 199 persons
- From 200 to 399 persons
- From 400 to 1,000 persons
- More than 1,000 persons in the absence of indigenous urban aggregations
- One or more indigenous towns of more than 5,000 inhabitants but none of more than 50,000


This question and possible answers are the same as in the question EA031 in The Ethnographic Atlas ([Gray](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Gray1999) [1999](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Gray1999); [Murdock et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:MurdockEtAl1999) [1999](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:MurdockEtAl1999)). Variable EA031 can be found in D-PLACE ([Kirby et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:KirbyEtAl2016) [2016](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:KirbyEtAl2016); [Kirby et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:KirbyEtAl2018a) [2018](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:KirbyEtAl2018a); see https://d-place.org/parameters/EA031).


## Examples

- The entry for Nganasan society (Nganasan, Uralic; Russian Federation) in D-Place lists the mean size of local communities as less then 50 persons.
- The entry for Lozi society (Lozi, Atlantic-Congo; Zambia) in D-Place lists the mean size of local communities as 50–99 persons.
- The entry for Ticuna society (Ticuna, Ticuna-Yuri; Colombia) in D-Place lists the mean size of local communities as 100–199 persons.
- The entry for Mekeo society (Mekeo, Austronesian; Papua New Guinea) in D-Place lists the mean size of local communities as 200–399 persons.
- The entry for Hano society (Arizona Tewa, Kiowa-Tanoan; United States of America) in D-Place lists the mean size of local communities as 400–1,000 persons.
- The entry for Mam society (Mam, Mayan; Guatemala) in D-Place lists the mean size of local communities as more than 1,000 persons without indigenous urban aggregations.
- The entry for Jebala society (Jebli, Afro-Asiatic; Morocco) in D-Place lists the mean size of local communities as 5,000–50,000 persons.

## Theoretical Support

Humans arrange themselves socially in fairly small populations. [Dunbar](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Dunbar1993) ([1993](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Dunbar1993)) shows that human social groups tend to be between 100 and 250 persons, averaging to 150 individuals. Such groups are maintained by interaction of sufficiently regular basis that the social bonds are based on direct personal knowledge. Social groups can be larger but then there's a need for intermediating authorities within the group; otherwise social cohesion could not be maintained and the group would disperse ([Dunbar](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Dunbar1993) [1993](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Dunbar1993): 686–687).

- *very frequently*
- *frequently*
- *neither frequently nor infrequently*
- *infrequently*
- *very infrequently*
## Goal
This question aims to get a sense of how dense social networks for interaction are. This question is similar to the S1 question in the domains questionnaire, but asks for an overall characterisation of Focus Group social networks, rather than in specific domains.
## Definitions

- *In-group:* a social group of people that Focus Group people identify as being a member of. This may or may not overlap with a linguistic group.
- *Out-group:* a social group that a focus group individual would say is not a member of their social group. This may or may not overlap with a linguistic group.
The scale is as follows:

- *Very frequently:* Characterisable as “a relatively significant amount of the year”, or an aggregate of 50 days or more of interaction in a year. Other possibilities: frequently recurring but short interactions (e.g. every week), or prolonged interaction for limited periods of time (e.g. 2 months a year or more).
- *Frequently*: Characterisable as “some parts of the year”, or an aggregate of approximately 4-5 weeks/28-35 days of interaction in a year. Frequent enough, but not enough to characterise as “very frequently”.
- *Neither frequently nor infrequently:* Characterisable as ""some part of the year"". Neither frequently, nor infrequently.
- *Infrequently*: Characterisable as “rarely in a year”, or an aggregate of 2-3 weeks/14-21 days of interaction in a year. Infrequent enough that it is difficult to characterise as “very infrequently”
- *Very infrequently*: Characterisable as “almost never”, or less than 5 days maximum in a year. Other possibilities: once year for a couple of days, or interactions occur based on incidental opportunities.

## Theoretical & Empirical Support
This question taps certain aspects of social network density. In dense social networks people interact mostly with other in-group people, that is, with their intimates. In loose social networks people interact mostly with out-group people, that is, with strangers. Interacting with in-group vs. out-group may have repercussions to one's language use, because we tend to share more norms and common ground with our in-group compared to out-group people.

With this question we aim to get a sense of how dense social networks for interaction are, although interacting with strangers provides just one aspect of network density. Language variation and change studies on social networks assume a network of social interaction (e.g. empirical work by [Milroy & Milroy](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:MilroyMilroy1985) [1985](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:MilroyMilroy1985); [Lippi-Green](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Lippi-Green1989) [1989](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Lippi-Green1989); modelling work by [Fagyal et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:FagyalEtAl2010) [2010](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:FagyalEtAl2010)). Social networks may be approached from different perspectives. One is the strength of connection, which represents interactional frequency, that is, how often people speak to one another. This aspect of networks is approached in the domains questionnaire. Another perspective is about interaction with intimates vs. strangers, and it is this aspect of networks that we emphasize with this question. Both aspects are needed because individuals networks may differ considerably.

## Goal

This question and question OT2 guide the respondent into thinking about the time frame of contact between the Focus Group and Neighbour Group. Ideally, in order to test for linguistic adaptation, one would want to know about the contact situation before present; it is the past that is likely to have provided the right sociohistorical context for changes in language structures to occur.

In this question we are asking about the general duration of contact overall, disregarding domain specificity. Here we will leave aside the question of whether the contact was intense/significant/meaningul, and focus on whether contact was occuring in some form for some duration.

Since it is difficult to generalise across the time-depth of contact scenarios worldwide, in this questionnaire we refrain from establishing any a priori chronological cut-off points for the contact situations we study. Instead, we aim to study the relevance of time bottom-up, that is, by asking respondents to (a) make an assessment of the duration of contact between Focus Group and Neighbour Group  (this question), and (b) identify the time frame of densest contact between Focus Group and Neighbour Group (OT2). We then request the respondent to answer the rest of the questionnaire from the perspective of this time frame. In doing so, we hope to gain an understanding of the contact situations at stake that is maximally entrenched in the specifics of their linguistic and social ecologies.
## Definitions

Testing for linguistic adaptation presumes an understanding of the contact situation before the present, since it is the sociohistorical context of the past which may have led to changes in language structures that are visible today. However, given the challenges in generalising across the time-depth of contact scenarios worldwide, this questionnaire refrains from establishing any a priori chronological cut-off points for the contact situations we study.

We attempt to study the relevance of time in a bottom-up fashion by asking respondents to perform two tasks.

1) To make an assessment of the duration of contact between Focus Group and Neighbour Group in a given social domain (this question);
2) To identify the time frame of densest contact between Focus Group and Neighbour Group in that social domain (P3) in the past.

Once the time frame is identified, the respondent should answer the remaining questions from this time frame's perspective, for the domain in question.

The assessment of the duration and density of contact may include the contemporary situation in the following instances:

(a) if it is the only time setting the respondent can answer for,
(b) if the contemporary situation represents a continuation of contact in the past.

## Definitions

Densest contact: the greatest opportunity for interaction, for the greatest number of people.
The assessment of the duration and density of contact may or may not include the contemporary situation, depending, on whether, for instance, the contemporary situation may be extrapolated to the past, or on whether it is the only time setting the respondent can answer for.
## Examples

Some possible ways to delimit the time frame of densest contact:

_Using the present to describe the past_
While there are dangers in drawing parallels from the present to the past ([Bergs](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Bergs2012) [2012](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Bergs2012); [Trudgill](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Trudgill2020) [2020a](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Trudgill2020) for sociolinguistics; [Hodder](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Hodder1995) [1995](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Hodder1995), [Wenke](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Wenke1980) [1980](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Wenke1980) for archaeology), there is some evidence from across the globe that historical patterns of interaction may persevere despite major historical upheavals occurring. For example, [Lindstedt](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Lindstedt2016) ([2016](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Lindstedt2016)) writes of the Balkans that some local linguistic situations reflect the multilingualism of the past despite one hundred years passing since the Balkan Wars. [Dickson](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Dickson2015) ([2015](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Dickson2015)) shows the maintenance and transmission of cultural knowledge in certain domains are robust among traditional speakers of Marra in Northern Australia. The grandchildren of the oldest Marra speakers are now speaking Kriol, but the domains of interaction and knowledge transmission are still standing. A similar observation has been made about Maori in New Zeland ([Chrisp](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Chrisp2005) [2005](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Chrisp2005)). [Sookias et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:SookiasEtAl2018) ([2018](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:SookiasEtAl2018)) found that deep cultural ancestry can explain contemporary cultural phenomena (although more recent historical events are a better predictor of cultural similarity across groups).

_Projecting to a known period of dense-most contact prior to significant disruptive changes in the language ecology of the two groups_

We use the label disruptive change to signify any major socio-political and/or natural event that fundamentally affected the linguistic ecology of the speech communities under study. Examples of socio-political upheavals are events related to modernisation such as industrialisation, colonisation, massive population movements related to wars and persecutions. Examples of natural disruptive events include volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, floods.

## Goal

This question first establishes whether the social domain is a locus of social contact between the Focus Group and Neighbour Group. If there is no social contact in this domain, respondents will skip this portion of the questionnaire.


## Definitions

For the purposes of this project, language contact is defined as *social contact* in a broad psychological and socio-cultural setting ([Weinreich](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Weinreich1953) [1953](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Weinreich1953)). Language contact is a phenomenon that occurs in interactions between individuals who are bi- or multilingual to varying extents. In other words, both the individual speaker and their socio-cultural context are requisites for language contact. We follow the understanding that bilingual speakers are at the heart of any given contact scenario ([Myers-Scotton](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Myers-Scotton2005) [2005](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Myers-Scotton2005); [Matras](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Matras2009) [2009](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Matras2009); [Muysken](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Muysken2013) [2013](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Muysken2013); [Li & Zhu](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:LiZhu2013) [2013](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:LiZhu2013); [Winford](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Winford2013) [2013](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Winford2013); [de Bot & Bülow](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:deBotBulow2020) [2020](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:deBotBulow2020)). Additionally, we view bilingual speakers as active participants in their socio-cultural environments ([Aikhenvald](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Aikhenvald2007) [2007](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Aikhenvald2007); [Pfänder & Siegel](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:PfanderSiegel2015) [2015](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:PfanderSiegel2015); [Yakpo](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Yakpo2020) [2020](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Yakpo2020)).

Testing for linguistic adaptation presumes an understanding of the contact situation before the present, since it is the sociohistorical context of the past which may have led to changes in language structures that are visible today. However, given the challenges in generalising across the time-depth of contact scenarios worldwide, this questionnaire refrains from establishing any a priori chronological cut-off points for the contact situations we study.

We attempt to study the relevance of time in a bottom-up fashion by asking respondents to perform two tasks.

1) To make an assessment of the duration of contact between Focus Group and Neighbour Group in a given social domain (this question);
2) To identify the time frame of densest contact between Focus Group and Neighbour Group in that social domain (P3) in the past.

Once the time frame is identified, the respondent should answer the remaining questions from this time frame's perspective, for the domain in question.

The assessment of the duration and density of contact may include the contemporary situation in the following instances:

(a) if it is the only time setting the respondent can answer for,
(b) if the contemporary situation represents a continuation of contact in the past.

## Goal

This question and question [P2](P2.md) guide the respondent into thinking about the time frame of contact between the Focus Group and Neighbour Group. Ideally, in order to test for linguistic adaptation, one would want to know about the contact situation before present; it is the past that is likely to have provided the right sociohistorical context for changes in language structures to occur.

However, since it is difficult to generalise across the time-depth of contact scenarios worldwide, in this questionnaire we refrain from establishing any a priori chronological cut-off points for the contact situations we study. Instead, we aim to study the relevance of time bottom-up, that is, by asking respondents to (a) make an assessment of the duration of contact between Focus Group and Neighbour Group in a given social domain ([P2](P2.md)), and (b) identify the time frame of densest contact between Focus Group and Neighbour Group in said social domain (this question). We then request the respondent to answer the rest of the questionnaire from the perspective of this time frame. In doing so, we hope to gain an understanding of the contact situations at stake that is maximally entrenched in the specifics of their linguistic and social ecologies.


## Definitions

- *Densest contact*: the greatest opportunity for interaction, for the greatest number of people.
- The assessment of the duration and density of contact may or may not include the contemporary situation, depending, on whether, for instance, the contemporary situation may be extrapolated to the past, or on whether it is the only time setting the respondent can answer for.

## Examples

Possible ways to delimit the time frame of densest contact:

- *Using the present to describe the past* While there are dangers in drawing parallels from the present to the past ([Bergs](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Bergs2012) [2012](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Bergs2012); [Trudgill](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Trudgill2020a) [2020a](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Trudgill2020a) for sociolinguistics; [Hodder](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Hodder1995) [1995](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Hodder1995) for archaeology), there is some evidence from across the globe that historical patterns of interaction may persevere despite major historical upheavals occurring. For example, [Lindstedt](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Lindstedt2016) ([2016](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Lindstedt2016)) writes of the Balkans that some local linguistic situations reflect the multilingualism of the past despite one hundred years passing since the Balkan Wars. [Dickson](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Dickson2015) ([2015](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Dickson2015)) shows the maintenance and transmission of cultural knowledge in certain domains are robust among traditional speakers of Marra in Northern Australia. The grandchildren of the oldest Marra speakers are now speaking Kriol, but the domains of interaction and knowledge transmission are still standing. A similar observation has been made about Maori in New Zealand ([Chrisp](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Chrisp2005) [2005](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Chrisp2005)). [Sookias et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:SookiasEtAl2018) ([2018](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:SookiasEtAl2018)) found that deep cultural ancestry can explain contemporary cultural phenomena (although more recent historical events are a better predictor of cultural similarity across groups).
- *Projecting to a known period of dense-most contact prior to significant disruptive changes in the language ecology of the two groups*We use the label *disruptive change* to signify any major socio-political and/or natural event that fundamentally affected the linguistic ecology of the speech communities under study. Examples of socio-political upheavals are events related to modernisation such as industrialisation, colonisation, massive population movements related to wars and persecutions. Examples of natural disruptive events include volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, floods.

## Goal

Through this question we wish to gain an understanding of the array of languages in use within a given social domain, beyond the two languages of interest. We are aware that the analysis of contact situation through the sets we propose has limitations. For instance, contact influence on the Focus Group languages may come from other languages than those selected as Neighbour Group languages in a given set. This question asked so that we can have some awareness of what other languages may have influenced the Focus Group language.


## Examples

- See support below.

## Theoretical & Empirical Support

The northwestern Cameroonian region of Lower Fungom shows very high degrees of linguistic diversity. As many as seven languages are associated with the thirteen villages recognised for the area, and speakers’ linguistic repertoires are considerably fluid ([Di Carlo & Good](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:DiCarloGood2014) [2014](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:DiCarloGood2014); [Di Carlo et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:DiCarloEtAl2019) [2019](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:DiCarloEtAl2019)). In this situation, there are a large number of other languages that could be of consequence for the structures of the Focus Group language. The same applies to the highly multilingual regions of Northern Australia, such as the Warruwi Community ([Singer](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Singer2018) [2018](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Singer2018)), and to the Vaupés in Northern Amazonia ([Epps](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Epps2018) [2018](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Epps2018)).

Even beyond small-scale multilingual settings, contact between pairs of unrelated languages may additionally feature the use of lingua francas and languages of wider communication, as is currently the case of English for many parts of the world.

## Goal

This question aims to get a sense of the frequency of interactions between Focus Group and Neighbour Group in the domain. We take the frequency of interaction as one measure of the degree of integration between the respective groups of people. If Focus Group people interact with Neighbour Group people a lot, we may say that the people from both groups are highly embedded in the social network. Put another way, we are looking at one dimension of social network density: the higher the frequency of interaction, the stronger the ties between peoples of the two groups.

Please note that questions DFK12 and DFK03 have modified scales and wordings of the question particular to the domain.


## Definitions

We have chosen to frame frequency both in terms of absolute and relative frequencies:

- Absolute frequencies are in terms of time unit measurements such as days and years.
- Relative frequencies would be for what makes sense in specific situations.
## Examples

The scale is as follows:

- *Very often*: Characterisable as “consistently throughout the year”. Other possibilities: frequently recurring but short interactions (e.g. a few days every week), or prolonged interaction for limited periods of time (e.g. once a year for several weeks).
- *Often:* Characterisable as “some parts of the year”, or an aggregate of approximately 4-5 weeks/28-35 days of interaction in a year. Often enough, but not enough to characterise as “very often”.
- *Sometimes:* Characterisable as “some parts of the year.” Neither often nor rarely.
- *Rarely:* Characterisable as “rarely in a year”, or an aggregate of 2-3 weeks/14-21 days of interaction in a year. Rarely enough that it is difficult to characterise as “very rarely”
- *Very rarely*: Characterisable as “almost never”, or less than 5 days maximum in a year. Other possibilities: once year for a couple of days, or interactions occur based on incidental opportunities.

The “one year” is chosen based on an intuition that most societies have so kind of temporal organisation that corresponds to a calendar year
## Theoretical & Empirical Support

Language variation and change studies on social networks assume a network of social interaction, as opposed to other kinds of network structures when studying specific language phenomena. The ties between people in a network of social interaction can be characterised in a variety of ways, with interactional frequency being one option; that is, how often people speak to one another ([Easley & Kleinberg](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:EasleyKleinberg2010) [2010](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:EasleyKleinberg2010): 53). Empirical work by [Milroy & Milroy](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:MilroyMilroy1985) ([1985](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:MilroyMilroy1985)) and [Lippi-Green](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Lippi-Green1989) ([1989](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Lippi-Green1989)) also collected frequency of interaction data when representing the social networks of their respective communities.
The untested assumption is that frequency of interactions can be aggregated and assumed to have similar effects on language learning and use, although this assumption is not something we have investigated in-depth the literature at this point in time.
While not the primary purpose, this question may also give an indication of shared norms of behaviour in the domain. We may surmise the more frequent the interaction between people, the more likely there are shared norms.

## Goal

This question is closely tied to the notion of esoteric vs. exoteric communication ([Thurston](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Thurston1987) [1987](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Thurston1987); [Wray & Grace](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:WrayGrace2007) [2007](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:WrayGrace2007)). The hypothesis is that esoteric communication is common in small groups with high amounts of interpersonal communication and shared norms. These communication patterns are hypothesised to result in certain kinds of interaction styles and linguistic patterns. In contrast, exoteric communication is thought to be common in larger groups where people will likely interact with complete strangers, which will beget interaction and linguistic patterns that are different to those of esoteric communication. These broad communication types are hypothesised as impacting the evolution of different linguistic structures. *Dyad* vs *group* communication is one way to characterise this distinction in communication types.
## Definitions

- *Dyadic communication*: Models of dyadic communication are described as taking place “between pairs engaged in a tightly coupled collaborative process aimed at establishing a mutual understanding of what is being discussed” ([Fay et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:FayEtAl2000) [2000](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:FayEtAl2000): 481). The notion overlaps heavily with a dialogic model of communication (e.g. dialogue-like communication). [Schober & Clark](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:SchoberClark1989) ([1989](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:SchoberClark1989)) demonstrated that people who overhear dialogue understand much less of what is being communicated than the people who are engaged in the dialogue. In other words, we are using the term *dyadic* somewhat synonymously to the term *interpersonal* in social psychology ([Simpson](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Simpson2007) [2007](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Simpson2007): 588).
- *Group-based communication*: Characterised as being broad-cast like, and a monologic style of communication. In this model, “Each speaker… broadcasts his or her message to all the other members of the group… Those who speak the most at the meeting broadcast the most information to the rest of the group.” ([Fay et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:FayEtAl2000) [2000](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:FayEtAl2000): 481). In such communicative contexts, explicit work must be done by the speaker to establish common ground.


The scale is as following:

- *Practically always under 5 people*: e.g. up to 90% of the time up
- *Often under 5 people*: e.g up to 70% of the time
- *Sometimes under 5 people*: up to 50% of the time up
- *Rarely under 5 people:* up to 30% of the time
- *Practically never under 5 people*: up to 10% of the time

## Theoretical Support
Communicative pressures of dyadic vs group-like interactions are different, and have consequences over time for how a communicative system changes (cf. [Atkinson et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:AtkinsonEtAl2018) [2018](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:AtkinsonEtAl2018)). Dyadic vs group-like interaction is also found to affect how individuals are influenced by others. Experimental work by [Fay et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:FayEtAl2000) ([2000](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:FayEtAl2000)) found that dialogue-like interaction show dyad members being influenced most by those with whom they interact in the discussion, while group-based communication is more monologue like, members are influenced most by the dominant speaker. This would have consequences for modelling the diffusion and adoption of linguistic innovations through a social network.

What exactly constitutes a dyad-like vs group like configuration varies across studies. For example different experiments choose different thresholds. The [Fay et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:FayEtAl2000) ([2000](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:FayEtAl2000)) experiment had up to 5 people for the dyadic condition, and over 10 as the group condition. [Atkinson et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:AtkinsonEtAl2018) ([2018](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:AtkinsonEtAl2018)) did their experiments on pairs vs triads to test for emergence of communicative conventions. [Fay & Ellison](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:FayEllison2013) ([2013](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:FayEllison2013)) have a pairs vs group of eight set up for their iterated learning experiment investigating the effect of population size.

We have chosen to follow the [Fay et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:FayEtAl2000) ([2000](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:FayEtAl2000)) set up, defining dyad-like as a group of up to five people, while groups of over five are considered more “group like” (see [Fay et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:FayEtAl2000) ([2000](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:FayEtAl2000)) for empirically grounded rationale). We have chosen this number since real-life interactions of people are rarely completely dyadic, so we surmised that a number of people which still produced a dyad-like effect is sufficient to capture the intended effect of the esoteric communicative condition.

## Goal

This question tells us about the level of integration between Focus Group and Neighbour Group people in a network. In this question we take the physical proximity of individuals as one way of inferring how frequently people may be interacting with one another.


## Definitions

- *Very proximate to each other:* There is little to no effort in reaching one another, and does not bear considering as effortful.
- *Proximate to each other*: There is some effort in reaching one another, but no real planning is necessary.
- *Somewhat proximate to each other*: There is some effort required to reach one another, and some planning may be necessary. The effort required is not so large as to dissuade travel if there is an imperative. Less than a days worth of travel.
- *Far from each other*: There is effort required to reach one another, and some degree of planning is required, with some physical discomfort expected. Maximum, a days worth of travel.
- *Very far from each other*: There is considerable effort required to reach one another. Logistic considerations and planning must be made. Requires one or more overnight travel.

## Theoretical & Empirical Support

Dialectological studies have shown there is a statistical tendency for geographically proximate varieties to be more similar than distant ones ([Nerbonne & Kleiweg](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:NerbonneKleiweg2007) [2007](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:NerbonneKleiweg2007)), which also seem to hold for rural, small scale societies (e.g. rural China, [Stanford](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Stanford2012) [2012](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Stanford2012)). It has been shown in social network analyses that geography and physical distance play a role in the flow of information across a network (see [Easley & Kleinberg](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:EasleyKleinberg2010) [2010](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:EasleyKleinberg2010): 315-318 for trade networks). Given these macro level findings, we assume there is some relationship between geographic proximity, physical proximity, and interactional frequency.

The measures of distance in the answer selection were chosen in order to be applicable to different types of social ecologies (e.g. as in non-urbanised ~ highly urbanised ecologies). It seems that measures that account for social geography, and effort of travel, are the best way to account for cross-culturally different manifestations of social distance. For example, culturally relevant social distances are used in dialectological studies to get a sense of physical distance/proximity, rather than Euclidean distance (e.g [Gooskens](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Gooskens2005) [2005](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Gooskens2005) for travel times along roads in Norway, and [Stanford](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Stanford2012) [2012](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Stanford2012) for rice paddy distances in rural China).

Frequency of interaction is assumed to play some role in contributing to the total pool of linguistic influences an individual is affected by. While the precise role of frequency of interaction is presumably dependent on other factors, we wish to identify it as one factor that may, in relation to other social factors, contributes to some kind of linguistic change outcome.

The interaction of face-to-face communication as a factor with geographic distance is also stated in Location Theory ([Hägerstrand](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Hagerstrand1967) [[1953] 1967](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Hagerstrand1967)), a theory central in sociolinguistics of variation and change (cf. [Chambers & Trudgill](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:ChambersTrudgill1998) [1998](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:ChambersTrudgill1998); [Johnstone](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Johnstone2010) [2010](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Johnstone2010): 209). Location Theory posits that “innovation spreads in a community through a network of face-to-face interpersonal communication such that the likelihood of adoption at a given site is higher when it is close to a site of previous adoption” ([Yapa](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Yapa1996) [1996](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Yapa1996): 238). The assumption is that “interaction becomes less frequent as a function of distance” ([Johnstone](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Johnstone2010) [2010](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Johnstone2010): 208).

## Goal

This question seeks information on the affective relationship betweenFocus and Neighbour Group people.

This question overlaps somewhat with question [BA](BA.md) which asks about positive/negative attitudes towards the Neighbour Group. While [BA](BA.md) concerns general attitudes regarding the other group in the overall abstract, this question is concerned with the nature of social ties between groups in terms of friendship.


## Definitions

- *Friendly:* e.g. Solidarity and alliances between groups are reinforced through various activities, people choose to spend time with one another for enjoyment.
- *Hostile:* e.g. There is hostility between the groups, but certain activities such as trade or exchange may be pursued because of economical/subsistence needs.

## Examples

- *Hostile ~ Neutral*: The overall negative attitude towards Romani by Hungarians (which is reciprocated) typically appears to be reflected in relationships between individuals. [Pogany](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Pogany2004) ([2004](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Pogany2004)) describes numerous relationships between individual Romani and Hungarians, but very few can be described as being “friendly” in the sense of choosing to spend time with one another, or building positive rapport with one another. Pogany’s publication is written with an eye towards depicting the difficult lives of many Romani so tends to present cases of hostile, discriminatory, or indifferent relationships between peoples of the two groups. Pogany, however, cites many other studies and reports from within the EU that all identify the various hardships that Romani experience. Depending the geographic region, and social domain that one focusses on, the relationship between Romani and Hungarians could thus be characterised between “hostile” through to “neutral”.

## Theoretical Support

Friendship is of interest because it is one of many ways to characterise strength of ties between individuals of a social network (cf. [Shi et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:ShiEtAl2007) [2007](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:ShiEtAl2007)). Friendship is also a parameter that affects an individual’s susceptibility to social influence. In other words, friends can influence each other (Easley & Kleiberg 2010: 90), and are also often part of a close-knit network. Face-to-face communication keeps together individuals within a close-knit network (also known as “structural cohesion of actors”, [Friedkin](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Friedkin1998) [1998](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Friedkin1998): 70), and such individuals appear more likely to be influenced by one another ([Friedkin](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Friedkin1993) [1993](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Friedkin1993)) than by individuals who are not friends.

Hostile relationships in a social network are known to have effects on the balance of a network’s structure (e.g. the *balance theorem* of [Harary](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Harary1953) [1953](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Harary1953); [Harary & Kabell](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:HararyKabell1980) [1980](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:HararyKabell1980)). Identifying imbalances in a network helps to identify localised clusters within any given network, since networks of individuals appear to seek out structural balance (i.e. networks only consisting of friendships) in order to avoid the stresses caused by having a hostile relationship within the network ([Easley & Kleinberg](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:EasleyKleinberg2010) [2010](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:EasleyKleinberg2010): 120–123). Identifying hostile relationships in a network therefore complements the picture of a network that is also identified on the basis of friendly relationships.

If Focus and Neighbour Group peoples can be characterised as having friendly relationships in one domain, we can take this as as a sign that the social network structure of the contact community within that domain is somewhat dense. On the other hand if the relationships between the two groups are hostile in one domain, we can take this as a sign that the overall social network structure of the contact community in that domain is somewhat loose.

## Goal

The purpose of this question is to seek a rough estimate of how thoroughly the social network of the Focus Group people has opportunities for social contact with the Neighbour Group in this domain. The more the social network is affected by contact, the more likely there are also different kinds of contact effects on language affected, for instance, by accommodation or code-switching. Those effects can depend on other things asked in this questionnaire, such as the language used in social contact.
## Definitions

- *Total Focus/Neighbour Group people:* the net population of Focus Group speakers, including those who are not immediately involved in this domain.
The scale is as follows:

- *Almost everyone*: A very high proportion, estimating roughly 90% or more of the total population
- *Many people*: A fairly high proportion, the majority of the Focus Group people, estimating around 66% of the total population
- *Some people*: An intermediate proportion, roughly 50% of the Focus Group total population have opportunities for contact with Neighbour Group people.
- *Few people*: A fairly low proportion, a minority of the people in the Focus Group, estimating around 33% of the total population
- *Almost no one:* A very low proportion, estimating 10% or less of the total population

## Theoretical Support

In earlier cross-linguistic research population size (e.g. [Lupyan & Dale](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:LupyanDale2010) [2010](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:LupyanDale2010)) and the proportion of second language speakers in the speech community (e.g. [Bentz & Winter](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:BentzWinter2013) [2013](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:BentzWinter2013)) have been used as proxies for language contact effects in language change or as a factor affecting the rate of language change. However, these approximations are problematic (see e.g. [Greenhill](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Greenhill2014) [2014](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Greenhill2014) for rate of change).
First, while proportion of second language speakers is perhaps a more direct way for measuring language contact compared to population size, it is not a consistent measure. For instance, similarly high proportions of L2 speakers may represent sociolinguistic situations that are very different from one another, one representing a situation where the language is used as a lingua franca and the other a situation in which the younger generation is learning the language of the elders (e.g. [Sinnemäki & Di Garbo](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:SinnemakiDiGarbo2018) [2018](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:SinnemakiDiGarbo2018)). For this reason, it is difficult to connect proportion of second language speakers consistently to a mechanism of language change. Second, population size should not be used as a proxy for contact effects, because it does not correlate even with proportion of second language speakers ([Sinnemäki & Di Garbo](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:SinnemakiDiGarbo2018) [2018](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:SinnemakiDiGarbo2018)). Third, researchers are divided over how population size affects rate of language change ([Greenhill](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Greenhill2014) [2014](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Greenhill2014): 562–564). There seems to be some consensus that population size affects rather of language change but there is no consensus as to how, meaning that it is not clear what the effect of population size would be.
This question is thus related to the issue of population size as a factor that affects language change, and linguistic structure. But because of the difficulty of defining the effect of population size, this question taps into the issue of group size by narrowing “the population” down to the people who are the likely innovators and/or transmitters of linguistic innovation in social contact.

## Goal

This question aims to capture the extent to which interactional dynamics in this domain affect transmission. By asking whether children actively participate in the activities typical of this domain, and by crosschecking this information with the data we gather on interactions between Focus and Neighbour Group in this domain, we try to get a sense of whether the domain provides an opportunity for children to learn the Neighbour Group language or other linguistic codes other than “their own”.
## Definitions

The criteria for answer selection are described below.

- *They practically always participate:* children are actively involved in the activities and verbal interactions of this social domain.
- *A lot*: Not as much as the adults, but still participate in some activities and verbal interactions of this social domain.
- *Somewhat*: They participate in the activities and verbal interactions of this social domain., but are less involved than adults.
- *A little*: i.e. just being present in the space of this social domain, but uninvolved in interactions
- *They practically never participate:* children are not involved in this social domain.

- The Focus Group language
- The Neighbour Group language
- Some other language
- This is highly contextual


## Goal

This question seeks to understand what languages Focus Group parents may speak with their children. The goal is to examine and understand family linguistic practices in multilingual, language contact contexts with an eye towards transmission across generations.


## Definitions

- *The Focus Group language/The Neighbour Group language/Some other language:* So-called monolingual modes of interaction. These options are mutually exclusive; that is, if more than one language is used in interaction, please select the fourth option, ""This is highly contextual.”
- *This is highly contextual:* encompasses interaction in which more than one language is used, including but not limited to phenomena that come under the umbrella terms ""code-switching"" or ""code-mixing.”
- *Parent:* For this study, we define the parent as the guardians or adults who are the primary caretakers of the child. We look to understand family linguistic practices better, and thus it is crucial to understand the input children receive from their primary caregivers. In addition, we recognize that family practices vary across communities/cultures. For these reasons, we want to clarify that the adults responsible for taking care of a child on a day-to-day basis will be considered the parents in these contexts.
- *Language dominance:* The concept that a bilingual individual expresses themselves with more ease in one of the two languages in their linguistic repertoire. Language dominance is understood in relation to language proficiency. The dominant language is one that one unofficially recognizes as the language in which one possesses higher proficiency based on language preference and can be measured with Mean Length of Utterance (MLU) which is expected to be higher in the more dominant language ([Yip & Matthews](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:YipMatthews2006) [2006](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:YipMatthews2006); 2007).

## Theoretical & Empirical Support

Consider the following scenario, a home environment consisting of a Cantonese-speaking, Focus Group parent and an English-speaking, Neighbour group parent together with their child(ren) in Hong Kong.
*This is highly contextual:* [Yip & Matthews](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:YipMatthews2007) ([2007](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:YipMatthews2007)) studied children’s linguistic development among several children (three of their own) who have been exposed to Cantonese and English regularly since birth. Hong Kong is 90% Cantonese-speaking which clearly means a child will be more highly exposed to Cantonese in their local community as opposed to English. Hong Kong’s linguistic policies state “‘biliterate and trilingual’, speaking Cantonese, Putonghua and English and being literate in both English and standard written Chinese” ([Yip & Matthews](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:YipMatthews2007) [2007](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:YipMatthews2007): 9). Thus, making this case study a language contact case study that helps us to understand language transmission with bilingual parents from both the Focus and Neighbour Group speech communities.

While the parents speak their respective language with their children, Cantonese is the dominant language due to their surroundings favoring Cantonese. Bilingualism is multi-faceted and fluctuates throughout a child’s development. Yip & Matthews’ discuss the time of “language silence”, the period when a child understands a language but does not necessarily possess the capacity to respond in one of their two home languages. This period varies from child to child. While developing both languages, Yip and Matthews report that one child would not respond to English and if the child did respond it was with one word, while one of the other children would occasionally respond to English utterances (both with father and outside investigator) in Cantonese ([Yip & Matthews](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:YipMatthews2007) [2007](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:YipMatthews2007): 81). We understand that children grow up with varying degrees of competency in their multilingual home settings and the study by Yip and Matthews reveals that the language that the child uses with their English-speaking (neighbour) parent varies throughout development.

In addition, code-mixing was regularly witnessed throughout the research. It was relatively common for the children to put English items into their Cantonese speech. It was less common, however, for Cantonese to enter the English speech ([Yip & Matthews](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:YipMatthews2007) [2007](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:YipMatthews2007): 83). The authors have no evidence that the code-mixing is a result of growing up bilingual as these speech preferences can also be a result of the input they receive from adults in their community in which Cantonese features English verbs and lexical elements (ibid.). A child displays language dominance and in this case in Cantonese. Over the years of crucial development, the utterances toward the Neighbour Parent can vary greatly. It is understood that the child will pass through a phase of “language silence” when their less dominant language is understood but not utilized much. While the child’s languages are developing they may respond with code-mixing, and as their language develops further, it is assumed they will continue code-mixing but at a lower rate. In this situation, where the linguistic choices of the child speaking to their Neighbour Group parent may include code-mixing the most representative answer would be, “This is highly contextual”.

- Constant supervision
- A lot of supervision
- Some supervision
- Little supervision
- No supervision at all


## Goal

Here we are interested in adult-to-child interactions specifically, unlike question [T6](T6.md) which seeks information on sources of socialisation more generally. In this question, we wish to capture the degree of involvement of adults in children’s activities. The activities may range from play, apprenticeships of cultural practices, and other community-relevant activities.


## Definitions

- *Constant supervision* if participating in activities, children always do that in the presence of adults and under their explicit and constant guidance.
- *A lot of supervision*: if participating in activities, children mostly do that in the presence of adults and under explicit guidance.
- *Some supervision*: if participating in activities, children partially do that in the presence of adults and under explicit guidance, and partially on their own.
- *Little supervision*: if participating in activities, children mostly do that on their own, with little input and guidance from the adults.
- *No supervision at all*: children are left alone in activities.

## Examples

- *Trade:* In the context of trade, we may imagine situations in which children of various ages participate in traditional trading activities in the presence of adults as a form of apprentice and/or in order to contribute to the household’s economical activities. In such contexts, the extent to which adults guide children in performing the tasks that are assigned to them may vary, and we may surmise that more explicit guidance also involves more opportunities of child-directed linguistic interactions.

## Theoretical & Empirical Support

Participating in ‘interactional communicative frames’ is key to language learning ([Stoll](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Stoll2016) [2016](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Stoll2016): 152). However, the interactional contexts children participate in greatly vary across cultures and socio-economic environments and it has been argued that this has an impact on language/community-specific patterns of language learning and use. For instance, in the Chitang-speaking community of Nepal, adults do not typically participate in playing (and related conversational activities) with children. According to [Stoll et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:StollEtAl2012) ([2012](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:StollEtAl2012)), this may explain the radical differences that exist between child and surrounding adult speech with respect to noun-verb ratio – Chitang-speaking children up to four years of age have a significantly higher ratio of nouns to verbs than adults.

In general, adult participation in children’s playing activities is most typical of WEIRD societies. In non-WEIRD societies children are more likely to interact with other children in the surrounding environment without any (or very little) involvement of adults ([Whitebread & Basilio](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:WhitebreadBasilio2013) [2013](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:WhitebreadBasilio2013)).

Beyond play, adults’ participation in activities involving children may fulfill a pedagogical function. For example, in Bali, from very early age children take part in music and dance rehearsals in the presence of adults. These training sessions prepare young children to become an integrative part of the music and dance performances that accompany many of the local ceremonial festivities ([Corona et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:CoronaEtAl2015) [2015](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:CoronaEtAl2015)).

This question aims to capture the extent to which interactional dynamics in this domain affect transmission. We are interested in the type of exposure a child may have to the language of the Neighbour Group through interactions with adult members of the community. If Focus Group children have the potential to learn a Neighbour Group Language in a particular social domain, we may surmise that the Focus Group and Neighbour Group have a high degree of contact where there are transmission opportunities for the Neighbour Group language.

## Goal

This question is trying to get a sense of what languages may be spoken by Focus Group children, within the contact situation at stake. The goal is to investigate possible domains of contact with an eye towards transmission across generations. The answer to this question is treated as one of a number of factors that play a role in affecting the outcomes of language change. The factor by itself is likely unable to affect outcomes, but in combination with other factors, is thought to play a role.


## Definitions

- *The Focus Group language/The Neighbour Group language/Some other language*: So-called monolingual modes of interaction. These options are mutually exclusive, that is, if more than one language is used in interaction, please select the fourth option, ""This is highly contextual”.
- *This is highly contextual*: encompasses interaction in which more than one language is used, including but not limited to phenomena that come under the umbrella terms ""code-switching"" and/or ""code-mixing"".

## Examples

- *This is highly contextual*: In communities practicing linguistic exogamy, children’s language choices largely depend on the language identity of the parents and the direction of the social exchange between the intermarrying groups, as defined by the marriage relationship. In many traditional Northern Australian language ecologies, for instance, children learned the mothers’ patrilect first (which they would use with their mothers and the members of her clan/band of origin), and only at the later stage did they switch to their father’s patrilect, which would also be the main language of interaction in the child’s local community ([Heath](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Heath1981) [1981](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Heath1981); [Johnson](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Johnson1991) [1991](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Johnson1991); [Stanford](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Stanford2008) [2008](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Stanford2008)). In this type of situation, where children’s language choices are the result of age-graded language socialization practices that are in turn connected with highly codified marriage patterns, the most appropriate answer to this question would be “This is highly contextual”.

## Theoretical & Empirical Support

Research on bilingual language acquisition demonstrates that bilingual children show the ability to tailor their own choice of language to the interlocutors’ native language and/or language of choice from the very early stages of language development, that is, approximately, from around their second year of life ([Mishina-Mori](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Mishina-Mori2011) [2011](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Mishina-Mori2011): 3122, and references therein).

In addition, research in language acquisition and socialization indicates that from a relatively early age children show awareness of cultural and language-specific communicative practices of their linguistic and social environment. For instance, Davison (2018) reports that, in the Murrinhpatha speech community of Northern Australia, traditional *kardu-thipman*categories (a complex system of categorization which situates aboriginal people in relation to the land and to other entities within the land, and regulates patterns of social interaction between adults) are used in children’s peer-talk already at age 3-4, as a means to identify and organise people in their own speech. This presupposes some degree of understanding of observed adult interactional behavior (Davison 2018: 221). Using 4-5 years of age as a cut-off point for this question adds a buffer to the relevant time frames suggested in the literature on child language acquisition.

## Goal

This question is trying to get a sense of what languages may be spoken by Focus Group children with people of the Neighbour Group who are 1) likely to be their age peers, and 2) likely to be at a similar developmental stage as themselves. The goal is to investigate possible domains of contact between peers who are in the early stages of language acquisition.

## Examples

- Rural adults speakers of the Afro-French creole Patwa encourage children to speak English as much as possible, while the use of Patwa is more encouraged in highly urbanised and educated contexts as a symbol of national identity. However, dominantly English-speaking children still use Patwa in everyday socializing activities and interactions with peers. This is related to the fact that the language “has become powerfully linked to adults roles and status”, which children imitate while engaging with other children, and independently of institutional language revitalization efforts ([Paugh](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Paugh2016) [2016](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Paugh2016): 128–129, and references therein).

## Theoretical & Empirical Support

Research in the field of language socialization indicates that, from a relatively early age children show awareness of cultural and language-specific communicative practices of their linguistic and social environment. Children apply this awareness in interaction with the adults in their lives, but also to their peers, and this is why we address the two dimensions through separate questions (see [T4](T4.md) for children’s output to adults). For instance, Davison (2018) reports that, in the Northern Australian Murrinhpatha speech community, traditional *kardu-thipman*categories (a complex system of categorization which situates aboriginal people in relation to the land and to other entities within the land, and regulates patterns of social interaction between adults) are used in children’s peer-talk already at age 3-4, as a means to identify and organise people in their own speech. This presupposes some degree of understanding of observed adult interactional behavior (Davison 2018: 221).

In addition, language socialization literature focusing on bi-/multilingual communities shows that linguistic practices involving child-peer interaction foster a wide range of age-graded language ideologies. These may have an impact on how languages are used, maintained, and transmitted in a community at a given point in time ([Paugh](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Paugh2016) [2016](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Paugh2016): 129). For instance, in situations of ongoing language shift, there might be a mismatch between linguistic practices involving language-learning children and official revitalization or maintenance efforts.

The answer to this question is treated as one of a number of factors that play a role in affecting the outcomes of language change. The factor by itself is likely unable to affect outcomes, but in combination with other factors, is thought to play a role.

## Goal

This question tells us about the likely sources of input in the acquisition of one or several languages. Through this question, we aim to get a glimpse of varying socialisation practices in a given social domain, and, in particular, whether these are age-segregated or not.


## Definitions

- *Peer group*: children from the same age cohort and not necessarily related by kin.
- *Sibling-kin group:* children from different age cohorts who are also related by kin.

## Examples

While in developed societies child-rearing and early socialization is, to a large extent, the responsibility of the parents, more socially distributed child-rearing styles are the default model of caregiving in many non-WEIRD cultures around the world ([Raj & Raval](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:RajRaval2013) [2013](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:RajRaval2013): 67). For instance, in many societies of south and south-east Asia, the social norm is that of distributed caregiving where other relatives and close friends are involved ([Kurrien & Vo](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:KurrienVo2004) [2004](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:KurrienVo2004): 67).

Moreover, while in modern Western societies peer socialisation is usually associated with interactions between same-age children who are not related by kin and come together through school settings, in more traditional societies, and even in Western societies beyond the school settings, e.g. the neighbourhood, older children tend to spend considerable part of their time caring for their younger kins. This fact has important implications for language socialisation (cf. [Goodwin & Kyratzis](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:GoodwinKyratzis2011) [2011](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:GoodwinKyratzis2011)). We acknowledge this distinction in our coding by separating socialisation within/by peer-group from socialisation within/by sibling-kin group.


## Theoretical Support

Input and interaction are fundamental to the language acquisition process ([Stoll](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Stoll2016) [2016](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Stoll2016): 141). However, the amount and type of input, as well as the amount and type of interaction that children receive and engage in while acquiring a language greatly differ across cultures and socioeconomic environments ([Stoll](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Stoll2016) [2016](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Stoll2016): 152, and references therein).

The literature on bilingual language acquisition suggests that using a language beyond the domain of parent-to-parent interaction (for instance with the extended family, cf. [Pauwels](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Pauwels2005) [2005](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Pauwels2005): 125) supports and contributes to its maintenance in the repertoire of the bilingual child. Knowing by whom children are likely to be socialised during the critical years of language development thus gives us a sense of how many opportunities of exposure to and interaction in a given language children have across social domains.

The choice of year 5 as the chronological upper end of this question’s time frame is motivated by the fact that in the literature on cognitive and language development, it is often argued that at about four years of age (or slightly earlier, i.e. around three years of age, depending on the variable/domain) children typically start showing indications of the ability to take the perspective of others both in terms of visual perception ([Flavell](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Flavell2004) [2004](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Flavell2004); [Frick et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:FrickEtAl2014) [2014](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:FrickEtAl2014)) and linguistic behaviour. See, for instance, [Fischer](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Fischer1958) ([1958](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Fischer1958)) and [Stanford](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Stanford2008) ([2008](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Stanford2008)) on children’s ability to show understanding and control of sociolinguistic variables, and Davison (2018) on the use of culturally and language-specific terms of address/identification in child-peer talk in the Northern Australian speech community of Murrinhpatha.

Adding a buffer of one year (from 4 to 5) and asking about the child’s sources of input during the first five years of age thus gives us a hint of the contexts where children may develop an understanding of the cultural and (socio-)linguistic identities of others, which they may then express through their own communicative choices.

## Goal

This question seeks to understand what languages Focus Group parents may speak with their children. The goal is to examine and understand family language practices in situations of language contact and multilingualism with an eye towards transmission across generations.

- *The Focus Group language/The Neighbour Group language/Some other language:* So-called monolingual modes of interaction. These options are mutually exclusive, that is, if more than one language is used in interaction, please select the fourth option, ""This is highly contextual”.

- *Mixed-speech:* speech that combines various codes (languages/language varieties) used at varying degrees in the speech. The speech is not purely one language nor another rather a combination of codes. Mixed-speech can alternately be referred to as “code-switching” or “code-mixing”.
- *Parent:* For this study, we define the parent as the guardians or adults who are the primary caretakers of the child. We look to understand family linguistic practices better, and thus it is crucial to understand the input children receive from their primary caregivers. In addition, we recognize that family practices vary across communities/cultures. For these reasons, we want to clarify that the adults responsible for taking care of a child on a day-to-day basis will be considered the *parents*in these contexts.

## Theoretical & Empirical Support

Consider the following scenario, a home environment consisting of an Okinawan-speaking, Focus Group parent and a Japanese-speaking, Neighbour group parent together with their child(ren), where Okinawan language is in contact with Japanese.

*This is highly contextual:* Located at the southernmost tip of Japan, one finds the Ryukyu Islands. This region is administratively divided into the Okinawa Prefecture and the Kagoshima Prefecture. The Okinawa Prefecture is a collection of 160 islands where the Okinawan language is in contact with Japanese. The Okinawan language has numerous regional dialects, some of which are mutually intelligible ([Maretzki & Maretzki](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:MaretzkiMaretzki1966) [1966](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:MaretzkiMaretzki1966): 370). Research collected by Thomas and Hatsumi Maretzki during 1954-55 states that Okinawa was “spoken in all households” and that “the first words learned by the child from his mother or others around him are in Okinawan” (ibid.: 370) at the time. Recent research reveals that intergenerational transmission of Okinawan has continually dropped since the 1950s, and Japanese has increasingly been the first language of those born after the 1950s ([Heinrich](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Heinrich2007) [2007](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Heinrich2007); 2016).

Nowadays, Ryukyuan residents are immersed in a language ecology including variants of Okinawa, Standardised Japanese and English. Residents possess varying degrees of competency in these languages. Heinrich’s research ([Heinrich et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:HeinrichEtAl2009) [2009](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:HeinrichEtAl2009)) shows that the questionnaire results from 2005 and 2006 reveal that the vitality of the Okinawa language is not promising as an astonishingly low level of residents address children in the local language. Decades-long language shift from Okinawa toward Japanese has increased what Heinrich explains as a mixed-speech variety. Mixed-speech is increasingly used across family-kin relationships (defined as spouses, children, parents, grandparents, neighbours, and colleagues). The middle generation (30-60 years of age) uses it more than the older generation (60-90 years of age), and an even further increased usage is reported among the younger generation (0-30 years of age) where the mixed speech is used across almost all domains ([Heinrich](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Heinrich2007) [2007](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Heinrich2007))**.**Intergenerational transmission decreased drastically since the 1950s which left those born after with a low command of Okinawa. This makes it increasingly difficult for parents to pass on the local language and even more so to use it in the home if the Japanese-speaking parent does not possess a command of the local language.

Furthermore, Heinrich’s research (2015) reveals that despite parents possessing a competency in Okinawan, it is reported that only 64% use it “rarely” or “not at all” with only 8% reporting using it “often” and 28% “sometimes”. The research clearly shows that Okinawan-speaking parents are increasingly choosing not to intergenerationally transmit Okinawan to their children. Those of child-bearing age will likely speak this mixed Okinawan-Japanese speech as opposed to speaking to their child in only Okinawan or only Japanese. When an Okinawan-speaking parent’s speech toward their child reflects that of “mixed speech”, the most appropriate answer to this question would be “This is highly contextual”.

## Theoretical & Empirical Support

Consider the following scenario, a home environment consisting of a Spanish-speaking, Focus Group parent and a Nahuatl-speaking, Neighbour group parent together with their child(ren) in a region where Nahuatl is in contact with Spanish.

*This is highly contextual:* In Mexico, Nahuatl is in contact with Spanish in numerous states of Mexico. Of all the indigenous languages present in Mexico, Nahuatl is the most spoken with 1.5 million speakers. While Spanish dominates in public and formal domains such as school and work, research suggests that the highest usage of Nahuatl is reported in informal contexts and within close-knit social networks ([Hill & Hill](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:HillHill1986) [1986](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:HillHill1986); [Gomashie](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Gomashie2020) [2020](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Gomashie2020)). [Gomashie](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Gomashie2021) ’s study ([2021](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Gomashie2021)) focused purely on adult speech to reveal pertinent empirical findings that tell us about intergenerational language transmission in this speech community. The study showed that Nahuatl-speaking adults most preferred using both Nahuatl and Spanish toward children between ages 0-12 years of age, and interestingly, between ages 13-18, Nahuatl becomes the preferred language of interaction. The preference to use both Nahuatl and Spanish is understood as code-mixing. Spanish was reported to be the preferred language of contact with those not from the speech community. We understood that in a family with one Spanish-speaking parent and one Nahuatl-speaking parent, the Nahuatl-Speaking parent will communicate with their child in a mixed, Spanish-Nahuatl speech. Subsequently, the appropriate answer is “this is highly contextual” for a similar situation where the neighbour parent used mixed code choices when addressing their children.

## Theoretical & Empirical Support

Consider the following scenario, a home environment consisting of a Rapa Nui-speaking Chilean, Focus Group parent and a continental Spanish-speaking Chilean, Neighbour group parent together with their child(ren) on Easter Island.

*This is highly contextual:* The Rapa Nui- speaking community of Easter Island, Chile has been facing language shift towards Spanish over the past several decades. Essentially all island residents speak Spanish, and about 30% speak Rapa Nui at varying degrees of fluency. The influx of non-Rapa Nui speakers in the past century has changed the linguistic dynamic. After the growth in mainland migration, Spanish became the primary language of interaction across domains. The family and kin domain has been heavily affected by an increase in continental Chileans arrival to the island during the mid-1900s ([Makihara](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Makihara2005a) [2005a](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Makihara2005a)).

Makihara's research on Rapa Nui speech found that some Rapa Nui parents speak to their pre-verbal children in Spanish baby talk and will often address their speech-competent children in Spanish in one-on-one interaction, suggesting that a shift is occurring. Even when an adult addresses children in Rapa Nui, children instinctively respond in Spanish. Many children have obtained a passive knowledge of Rapa Nui with Spanish as the dominant language. The shift toward Spanish has been accelerated in part due to intermarriages between Continentals and local Rapa Nui. Despite the clear preference toward Spanish in the recent decades, the local Rapa Nui have displayed a desire to reclaim their language and cultural identity through syncretic speech patterns ([Makihara](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Makihara2005a) [2005b](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Makihara2005a)). Syncretic speech is marked by features of both languages. Although the speech is neither purely Spanish nor purely Rapa Nui, there is an intention to place features of both codes into their speech patterns. If an utterance is not understood when initially addressed under a certain language (be it Spanish or Rapa Nui), the syncretic variety will often be used to repeat the phrase ([Makihara](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Makihara2005a) [2005b](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Makihara2005a): 745-755).

In this type of situation, where children’s language choices with their Focus Group parents tend to include more than one code resembling syncretic speech, the most appropriate answer to this question would be “This is highly contextual” despite Spanish language dominance.
