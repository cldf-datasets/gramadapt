# OI8: How significant is language as part of group identity for the speakers of Focus Group language?

Authors: Kaius Sinnemäki

- Very insignificant
- Insignificant
- Neither insignificant nor significant
- Significant
- Very significant

## Goal

This question asks whether language is identified by speakers as emblematic of some kind of group identity.


## Definitions

- *Very insignificant:* language is not at all significant to group identity. The group's identity may be tied to some other factors, such as land or ethnicity.
- *Very significant:* language forms a very significant part of group identity. Language may be the strongest indicator of group identity, and threats to language are considered threats to the survival of the whole group.

## Theoretical & Empirical Support

Language is often an important part of group identity. Language identity plays an important role in linguistic choices and it may also affect other linguistic behavior (e.g. [Joseph](#source-Joseph2004) [2004](#source-Joseph2004); [Taylor-Leech](#source-Taylor-Leech2012) [2012](#source-Taylor-Leech2012); among many others). When language plays a significant role for group identity, it is transmitted to children when emigrating to another location or when education and better job opportunities are available in another language, for instance. If language is not important for group identity, this may affect language choice, such as not transmitting the heritage language to children or shifting to majority language that offers better possibilities for work and education. Especially in cases of language endangerment, successful revitalization efforts seem to require that language identity is strong so that the language will continue to be transmitted to children instead of the group shifting to another language.

[Law](#source-Law2014) 's ([2014](#source-Law2014)) studies of the related Mayan languages in Guatemala, Mexico, and Belize suggested that for Maya Lowlanders language did not form a significant part of their group identity and therefore extensive linguistic borrowing was possible. On the other hand, the vibrant social contact between Uruguyan Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese in the border communities of Brazil and Uruguay has not led to extensive linguistic transfer because of the prevailing linguistic ideology of standard national languages (e.g. [Carvalho](#source-Carvalho2014) [2014](#source-Carvalho2014); see also the related discussion in [Rodríguez-Ordóñez](#source-Rodriguez-Ordonez2019) [2019](#source-Rodriguez-Ordonez2019)). The result is rather a stable multilingual community where the linguistic codes are kept quite strictly separate. In these communities language thus forms a very significant part of group identity with major influence on linguistic behaviour.
