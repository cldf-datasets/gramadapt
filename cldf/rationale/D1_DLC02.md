# D1: Domain Detail - Local Community (DLC02)

Authors: Eri Kashima and Francesca Di Garbo
Focus Group people are the most likely to speak in an unmonitored way in:

- Nuclear family
- Band
- Neighbourhood or village
- Town or city
- Other

## Goal

Members of a local community may come to interact in several different spaces and situations. Having an understanding of what these spaces/domains of interaction are, and of which of them are associated with unmonitored speech registers, will give us a hint of the potential for contact between Focus and Neighbour Group.


## Definitions

- *Local Community*: Domain concerning the surroundings closes to the household environment, but outside the realm of family and kin. A space of interaction that may extend beyond a bounded geographical place (this is done in order to capture mobile groups (e.g. nomads) and other communities of practice).
- *Unmonitored speech:* Ways of speaking where speakers are paying less attention to the forms they produce, compared to situations where they do (such as formal situations). Overlaps somewhat with notions of "vernacular speech".

The possible answer options are as follows:

- *Nuclear Family*: Minimally, a unit of mother and child, or some culturally specific equivalent.
- *Band*: A collection of families that are connected by some culturally meaningful relational bond that is not geographically defined (e.g. descent, marriage, friendship, other).
- *Neighbourhood or village*: A collection of people who are primarily, though not always, defined as being of a particular geographic location (a Navajo camp which migrates seasonally is a non-geographical example). Neighbourhood and villages tend to be numerically small, roughly between 60 to 350~500 people. The numerical range is more of a guideline; if a neighbourhood is part of a larger city, we may expect a larger number of people (i.e. a suburb in New York). Choose this option if this is the case, rather than choosing town or city.
- *Town or city*:  Larger in terms of population and geographic spread than a neighbourhood or village. We assume that members of this unit do not know each other personally.
- *Other*: For example, vernaculars that are based on social categories such as race, ethnicity, religious denomination, clan, sexuality,  if these social groupings are geographically dispersed, and do not cluster/live closely to one another in places such as neighbourhoods and villages.

## Examples

- *Nuclear Family*: An example of society where the space of the local community largely coincides with the family/household are traditional reindeer pastoralist cultures who typically followed their herds throughout the year ([Vorren](#source-Vorren1978) [1978](#source-Vorren1978); [Næss et al.](#source-NaessEtAl2010) [2010](#source-NaessEtAl2010): 248). In such contexts, the space of use of unmonitored speech in the local community would coincide with the nuclear family.Choose “The nuclear family” if the groups you are answering for spend most of their daily time in the family/household environment, but may meet up with other groups during special occasions. (cf. wiki for examples from the ethnographic literature)
- *Town or city*: In Kupwar, of the Sangli district India, in the 1960s, the “neutral village language” is described as Marathi ([Kulkarni-Joshi](#source-Kulkarni-Joshi2016) [2016](#source-Kulkarni-Joshi2016): 149; [Gumperz & Wilson](#source-GumperzWilson1971) [1971](#source-GumperzWilson1971)), while different ethnic-religious-caste groups have their own home language. In this case, the Kupwar town-village would be the largest unit of the local community, and Marathi the language of this largest unit.
- *Other:*An example of what may count as ‘other’ in the proposed list of answer types would be those groups analysed under the community of practice model, such as being a jock/burn out ([Eckert](#source-Eckert1989) [1989](#source-Eckert1989)), or identifying with one’s sexual orientation ([Munson](#source-Munson2007) [2007](#source-Munson2007)). For most pre-modern communities, however, we assume this option is unlikely, and that most groups will have formed communities in geographic space.
- Choose “other” only if the community of practice associated with the use of unmonitored speech cannot be identified with any of the other interactional spaces listed above.

## Theoretical & Empirical Support

*On the importance of location*

We have chosen to identify the location of the local community both in terms of geographically situated units (i.e. neighbourhood, village), and those that are not (i.e. band). This is a reflection of a historical trend in modern linguistics to contrast agricultural vs non-agricultural language communities, which subsumes sedentary vs mobile societies, as well as small vs large populations (cf. [Bowern](#source-Bowern2010) [2010](#source-Bowern2010)). While there is great variability and diversity of configurations within the categories we have chosen, the intention of this question is to give a rough approximation of group size and mobility on a global level. Physical environments and geography undoubtedly play a role in both patterns of language variation, and diffusion of linguistic innovations (cf. [Johnstone](#source-Johnstone2010) [2010](#source-Johnstone2010)). In pre-modern communities, being geographically situated was a major factor that shaped peoples lives, so using physical-spatial/geographic units to capture some sense of local community seems justified. Language varieties which can be ascribed to the realm of ‘unmonitored speech’/‘informal registers’ may of course be used in group based on race and religion which do not presuppose a geographically bounded location. Such communities, however, still tend to be clustered into neighbourhoods and other physically proximate spaces (e.g. as shown in [Labov et al.](#source-LabovEtAl2006) [2006](#source-LabovEtAl2006) in the *Atlas of North American English*).

The number of people used to characterise the options are based on [Dunbar](#source-Dunbar1993) ([1993](#source-Dunbar1993)). Our “band” corresponds roughly to his “over-night camp”, our “neighbourhood or village” roughly corresponding to his “band/village”.

*On the importance of unmonitored speech*

Monitored vs unmonitored was chosen as an axis of importance because sociolinguistic theories inspired by Labovian variationist research identify the latter as the the locus where entrenchment of linguistic innovations occur ([Labov](#source-Labov1972a) [1972](#source-Labov1972a); cf. [Poplack & Tagliamonte](#source-PoplackTagliamonte1999) [1999](#source-PoplackTagliamonte1999)). The notion of “vernacular speech” is partially related with the amount of attention speakers pay to their speech in different communicative situations. Vernacular speech is typically used when communicating with intimates in familiar contexts ([Labov](#source-Labov1972a) [1972](#source-Labov1972a): 208). Evidence of linguistic innovations in unmonitored speech are then taken as a sign of diffusion through the community, and an entrenchment of the innovation in speakers’ repertoires.

There are other terms used in linguistics that fall under this notion of monitored vs unmonitored speech. Formal registers, for example, can be defined as speech styles that involve maximal attention to speech. They are typically used when communicating with non-intimates in non-familiar, highly codified contexts. Informal registers on the other hand are speech styles that correlate with minimal attention to speech and are typically used when communicating with intimates in familiar contexts.
