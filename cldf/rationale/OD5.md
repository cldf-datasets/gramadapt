## Goal

This question aims to collect data on the number of native speakers, much like the previous questions (OD1/OD3). This question more specifically asks about the *proportion* of native-like speakers, rather than absolute numbers of speakers.


## Definitions

- The term *native-like* *speakers* encompasses two types of people. First, it refers to those members of the language group who have learned the Focus Group language as the first language. Second, it refers to those members of the Focus Group who have learned the language since childhood and their competence in the language is comparable to first language learners.
- The term *non-native-like speakers* refers to speakers of the Focus Group language that have learned the language as an additional language but whose competence in the language is not as good as that of native-like speakers.


The scale is as follows:

- *Low proportion:* a small minority (roughly 20% or less) of all speakers are native-like speakers
- *Fairly low proportion:* a minority of all speakers (roughly 20–40%) are native-like speakers.
- *Intermediate proportion:* roughly half of all speakers (roughly 40–60%) are native-like speakers.
- *Fairly high proportion:* the majority of speakers (roughly 60–80%) are native like speakers
- *High proportion:* an overwhelming majority (roughly 80% or higher) of speakers are native-like speakers


This question is adapted from question SCCS1122 in the Standard Cross-Cultural Sample ([Murdock & White](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:MurdockWhite1969) [1969](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:MurdockWhite1969); [White](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:White2009) [2009](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:White2009)) that is available in D-PLACE ([Kirby et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:KirbyEtAl2016) [2016](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:KirbyEtAl2016); [Kirby et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:KirbyEtAl2018c) [2018c](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:KirbyEtAl2018c); see https://d-place.org/parameters/SCCS1122#2/14.3/151.3)


## Examples

- Focus Group = Finnish, Neighbour Group = Swedish, contemporary situation:According to the 2018 census of Finland, there are 4,840,000 L1 users of Finnish in Finland, and 30,000 speakers of Tornedalen Finnish speakers in Sweden. The Ethnologue lists the "total users in all countries" as 5,114,040. The same entry identifies the number of L2 Finnish speakers as 656,000. The answer to this question would 656,000/5,114,040 = approx. 11%, which falls into Category 1: Low proportion.

## Theoretical & Empirical Support

Proportion of native-like vs. non-native-like speakers has been used in the typological literature as a proxy for contact effects on language structures, especially on morphological complexity (e.g. [Bentz & Winter](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:BentzWinter2013) [2013](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:BentzWinter2013); [Sinnemäki & Di Garbo](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:SinnemakiDiGarbo2018) [2018](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:SinnemakiDiGarbo2018); [Sinnemäki](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Sinnemaki2020) [2020](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Sinnemaki2020)). We are not so keen on using this proportion as a measure on its own, because it may be linked to various different explanatory factors (see [Bentz & Winter](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:BentzWinter2013) [2013](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:BentzWinter2013): 3-5; and references there). Instead we intend to assess whether this proportion correlates with any other sociolinguistic features in our questionnaire. This will help us assessing whether this proportion can really serve as a proxy for the degree of language contact and its effects on language structures, whether it serves as a proxy for something else or whether it serves as a proxy for nothing theoretically interesting.
