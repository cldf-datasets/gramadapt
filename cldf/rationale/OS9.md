# OS9: How frequently do Focus Group people generally interact with out-group people?

Authors: Kaius Sinnemäki

- *very frequently*
- *frequently*
- *neither frequently nor infrequently*
- *infrequently*
- *very infrequently*
## Goal
This question aims to get a sense of how dense social networks for interaction are. This question is similar to the S1 question in the domains questionnaire, but asks for an overall characterisation of Focus Group social networks, rather than in specific domains.
## Definitions

- *In-group:* a social group of people that Focus Group people identify as being a member of. This may or may not overlap with a linguistic group.
- *Out-group:* a social group that a focus group individual would say is not a member of their social group. This may or may not overlap with a linguistic group.
The scale is as follows:

- *Very frequently:* Characterisable as “a relatively significant amount of the year”, or an aggregate of 50 days or more of interaction in a year. Other possibilities: frequently recurring but short interactions (e.g. every week), or prolonged interaction for limited periods of time (e.g. 2 months a year or more).
- *Frequently*: Characterisable as “some parts of the year”, or an aggregate of approximately 4-5 weeks/28-35 days of interaction in a year. Frequent enough, but not enough to characterise as “very frequently”.
- *Neither frequently nor infrequently:* Characterisable as "some part of the year". Neither frequently, nor infrequently.
- *Infrequently*: Characterisable as “rarely in a year”, or an aggregate of 2-3 weeks/14-21 days of interaction in a year. Infrequent enough that it is difficult to characterise as “very infrequently”
- *Very infrequently*: Characterisable as “almost never”, or less than 5 days maximum in a year. Other possibilities: once year for a couple of days, or interactions occur based on incidental opportunities.

## Theoretical & Empirical Support
This question taps certain aspects of social network density. In dense social networks people interact mostly with other in-group people, that is, with their intimates. In loose social networks people interact mostly with out-group people, that is, with strangers. Interacting with in-group vs. out-group may have repercussions to one's language use, because we tend to share more norms and common ground with our in-group compared to out-group people.

With this question we aim to get a sense of how dense social networks for interaction are, although interacting with strangers provides just one aspect of network density. Language variation and change studies on social networks assume a network of social interaction (e.g. empirical work by [Milroy & Milroy](#source-MilroyMilroy1985) [1985](#source-MilroyMilroy1985); [Lippi-Green](#source-Lippi-Green1989) [1989](#source-Lippi-Green1989); modelling work by [Fagyal et al.](#source-FagyalEtAl2010) [2010](#source-FagyalEtAl2010)). Social networks may be approached from different perspectives. One is the strength of connection, which represents interactional frequency, that is, how often people speak to one another. This aspect of networks is approached in the domains questionnaire. Another perspective is about interaction with intimates vs. strangers, and it is this aspect of networks that we emphasize with this question. Both aspects are needed because individuals networks may differ considerably.
