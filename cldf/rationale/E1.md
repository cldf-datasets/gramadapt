## Goal

We are interested to know about intuitions concerning other sources of language contact in the domain of trade in the past.


## Examples

If Focus Group are Estonians of Tallin, and Neighbour Group is Russian: we know that German speaking Hansa traders interacted with Estonian speakers, and there are many German loan words that can be traced to this period of trade. In which case, we would list other group/language as “German Hansa traders” and the linguistic consequence as “loan words”.
