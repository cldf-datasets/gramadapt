# D1: Domain Detail - Family & Kin (DFK02)

Authors: Eri Kashima and Francesca Di Garbo


## Goal

The goal of this question is to identify whether the family and co-residential unit are the same for the majority of the time over the course of a marriage. All societies appear to have different residential arrangements depending on the life stage of an individual (what in anthropological parlance is called *the development cycle*). We are interested in the degree of overlap between family and co-residential unit insofar as it has some kind of impact on language use and learning.


## Examples

- YES for *mothers (and their children) who live with their husbands as part of a co-residential unit*: Described as “nuclear family” or “conjugal unit”, e.g. nomad tents in parts of Kham, Tibet ([Thargyal](#source-Thargyal2007) [2007](#source-Thargyal2007)).
- YES for *mothers(and their children) live with their mothers:* Where both the husband and wife continue to reside with their families of origin even after marriage. Children usually reside with the mother. Described as natalocal residence in anthropological parlance, e.g. the Nayar of western Senegal ([Gough](#source-Gough1959a) [1959](#source-Gough1959a)), or the Akan of Ghana/Ivory Coast.
- YES for *mothers (and their children) live with their mother-in-laws:* Extended kin or other adults may also be living with the mother, husband, and children, such as Dayak long houses in Malaysia ([Harrison](#source-Harrison1976) [1976](#source-Harrison1976); [Helliwell](#source-Helliwell1992) [1992](#source-Helliwell1992)), and the Balkan *zadruga*. Families residing in separated private dwelling within a larger co-residential units fall in this category, e.g. Huave house-lots (ndén) in Mexico ([Diebold](#source-Diebold1966) [1966](#source-Diebold1966)).

## Theoretical & Empirical Support

Knowing whether a woman, her child, and the father of the child are cohabiting is important for two reasons. 1) Because we want to get a sense of how much opportunity a Focus Group person has to learn and use the Neighbour Group language from their Neighbour Group spouse, and 2) we want to get a sense of how much opportunity a Focus Group child has to learn and use the Neighbour Group language from their Neighbour Group parent.

Anthropological works show very clearly that a family is not necessarily the same as a daily co-residential unit. Research on child bilingual acquisition in interlingual households have found that the amount of input of a language heavily affects the likelihood of successful language transmission; especially if one of the parental languages is a minority language ([Yamamoto](#source-Yamamoto2001) [2001](#source-Yamamoto2001), [De Houwer](#source-DeHouwer2007) [2007](#source-DeHouwer2007)). Given this, we would want to know whether families do indeed spend much of their daily life together or not. If a family and co-residential unit do not overlap, we may surmise that there is less language learning and socialisation opportunities compared to a group where family and co-residential units do indeed overlap.

The answer to this question is treated as one of a number of factors that play a role in affecting the outcomes of language change. The factor by itself is likely unable to affect outcomes, but in combination with other factors, is thought to play a role.
