# BA: What is the overall attitude that Focus Group people have towards Neighbour Group people in domain X?

Authors: Eri Kashima

## Goal

In this question we aim to capture a general attitude that the Focus Group have towards the Neighbour Group within the domain. People's attitudes towards others have consequences for various aspects of interaction, and the rationale of attitudes generally are covered in the B-Set of questions.

This question overlaps somewhat with question [S5](S5.md) which asks about the friendliness between peoples of the Focus and Neighbour Groups. While question [S5](S5.md) concerns the nature of social ties between groups in terms of friendship, this question is concerned with a general belief about the other group in the abstract.


## Definitions

The scale is as follows:

- Very positive
- Positive
- Neutral
- Negative
- Very negative

## Examples

*Negative*: Chinese diaspora in the Solomon Islands have come predominantly in two waves, with the earlier wave being relatively established within the community of the capital Honiara. The relationship between locals and Chinese diaspora is complex, but there are a few aspects which would make this dynamic score a "negative" response to this question. There is little doubt that the relationship between Solomon Islanders on the one hand, and Chinese diaspora on the other, are not positive. [Moore](#source-Moore2008a) ([2008](#source-Moore2008a): 66) describes Solomon Islanders as having "long-term smouldering resentments against the economic hold of the 'old' Chinese citizens", but they are still viewed as part of the modern nation by virtue of having arrived during the British colonial era. The new diaspora who have arrived recently from the People's Republic of China are viewed in a much poorer light, and appear to be associated (in the eyes of Solomon Islanders) to the corrupt business practices of various Asian companies ([Moore](#source-Moore2008a) [2008](#source-Moore2008a): 65). Chinese businesses are seen to represent corrupt activities within the political and economic classes of the Solomon Islands. [Moore](#source-Moore2008a) ([2008](#source-Moore2008a): 82–83) reports that the 2006 rioters in Honiara distinguished between "old" and "new" waves of Chinese diaspora, where businesses run by the former were deliberately left untouched.

While the overall attitude of Honiarans towards the Chinese diaspora can be characterised as negative, we would choose the response "negative" rather than "very negative" due to the nuance displayed in discerning old vs new Chinese diaspora.


## Theoretical Support

We take positive/negative attitudes towards another as a factor that affects a person's openness to innovation. A person with a positive attitude towards their interlocutor is more likely to accommodate to them ([Giles](#source-Giles1978a) [1978](#source-Giles1978a); [Giles & Byrne](#source-GilesByrne1982a) [1982](#source-GilesByrne1982a)), and is also more likely to adopt innovations from them. A person with a negative attitude towards an interlocutor is less likely to accommodate. This negative attitude appears to result in divergence of maintenance of linguistic, cultural, and ethnic differences across groups ([Giles & Johnson](#source-GilesJohnson1981) [1981](#source-GilesJohnson1981); [Palomares et al.](#source-PalomaresEtAl2016a) [2016](#source-PalomaresEtAl2016a)). Put more mechanistically, a person with a positive attitude towards another person is a node that is vulnerable to innovations in a social network ([Collar](#source-Collar2007a) [2007](#source-Collar2007a): 153), and a person with a negative attitude is a node that is less vulnerable.

For contact situations, then, a person who is positively oriented towards a person from another linguistic group is less likely to monitor and reject aspects of an out-group's linguistic output. Simplistically put, a positive attitude may suggest a greater likelihood of contact-induced transfer.
