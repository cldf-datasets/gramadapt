- The Focus Group language
- The Neighbour Group language
- Some other language
- This is highly contextual


## Goal

This question seeks to understand what languages Neighbour Group parents may speak with their children. The goal is to examine and understand family linguistic practices in multilingual, language contact contexts with an eye towards transmission across generations.


## Definitions

- *The Focus Group language/The Neighbour Group language/Some other language:* So-called monolingual modes of interaction. These options are mutually exclusive, that is, if more than one language is used in interaction, please select the fourth option, "This is highly contextual”.
- *This is highly contextual:* encompasses interaction in which more than one language is used, including but not limited to phenomena that come under the umbrella terms "code-switching" and/or "code-mixing".
- *Parent:* For this study, we define the parent as the guardians or adults who are the primary caretakers of the child. We look to understand family linguistic practices better, and thus it is crucial to understand the input children receive from their primary caregivers. In addition, we recognize that family practices vary across communities/cultures. For these reasons, we want to clarify that the adults responsible for taking care of a child on a day-to-day basis will be considered the parents in these contexts.

## Theoretical & Empirical Support

Consider the following scenario, a home environment consisting of a Spanish-speaking, Focus Group parent and a Nahuatl-speaking, Neighbour group parent together with their child(ren) in a region where Nahuatl is in contact with Spanish.

*This is highly contextual:* In Mexico, Nahuatl is in contact with Spanish in numerous states of Mexico. Of all the indigenous languages present in Mexico, Nahuatl is the most spoken with 1.5 million speakers. While Spanish dominates in public and formal domains such as school and work, research suggests that the highest usage of Nahuatl is reported in informal contexts and within close-knit social networks ([Hill & Hill](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:HillHill1986) [1986](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:HillHill1986); [Gomashie](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Gomashie2020) [2020](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Gomashie2020)). [Gomashie](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Gomashie2021) ’s study ([2021](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Gomashie2021)) focused purely on adult speech to reveal pertinent empirical findings that tell us about intergenerational language transmission in this speech community. The study showed that Nahuatl-speaking adults most preferred using both Nahuatl and Spanish toward children between ages 0-12 years of age, and interestingly, between ages 13-18, Nahuatl becomes the preferred language of interaction. The preference to use both Nahuatl and Spanish is understood as code-mixing. Spanish was reported to be the preferred language of contact with those not from the speech community. We understood that in a family with one Spanish-speaking parent and one Nahuatl-speaking parent, the Nahuatl-Speaking parent will communicate with their child in a mixed, Spanish-Nahuatl speech. Subsequently, the appropriate answer is “this is highly contextual” for a similar situation where the neighbour parent used mixed code choices when addressing their children.
