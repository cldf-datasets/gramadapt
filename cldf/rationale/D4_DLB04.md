Is there hierarchy involved in work?
## Answer Options

Binary
- Yes
- No
## Goal

The aim of this question is to identify whether there are any formally recognised hierarchical relationships particular to the organisation of work in the contact situation at stake.
## Definitions

By _formally recognised_, we mean hierarchical positions within work which are named (see examples below).
## Examples

- _Yes_: Managers & subordinates
- Yes: Land owning Janins (Kannada-speakers) and Muslims and Hindus (Urdu-speakers) working the lands. ([Gumperz & Wilson](#source-GumperzWilson1971) [1971](#source-GumperzWilson1971))
## Theoretical & Empirical Support

The rationale for this question is grounded in the understanding that different communities of practice, and especially those associated with differences in power, can results in speech styles and practices that are unique to those contexts.  Knowing something about work hierarchy involving the groups in contact provides extra insight into the dynamics of "socio-economic power" which is thought to be highly significant in language contact situations (e.g. by [Thomason and Kaufman](#source-ThomasonKaufman1988) [1988](#source-ThomasonKaufman1988); [Yakpo](#source-Yakpo2020) [2020](#source-Yakpo2020)).

Being in positions of authority at work may lead to differential speech styles when compared to people in authoritative positions. A study of Tokyo Japanese natural speech found that being in positions of authority had consequences for the kinds of linguistic constructions favoured in production. Both men and women in positions of authority at work favored full-forms of predicates, in contrast to home-maker women who preferred fragmental and elided utterances ([Takano](#source-Takano2000) [2000](#source-Takano2000); 2001). The analysis presented is that this is difference is due to the relatively wider and heterogeneous communication networks of the workers in leadership positions, who are required to speak directly. The uses of utterance-final forms by working women and men in non-authoritative positions were found to be somewhere in between workers in positions of authority, and the homemakers.

Hierarchy in profession intersects with other societal variables, so we would not expect hierarchy in work alone to hold explanatory power over language variation. In Kupwar India profession, caste, and religion are highly correlated, so it is not hierarchy at work per se that is affecting language choice but the symbolic relationship between these combined factors. Urdu-speaking Muslims and Hindu “low” castes workers who worked in the farms owned by Kannada-speaking Jains are all said to have spoken Urdu, Kannada, and Marathi the neutral village language ([Gumperz & Wilson](#source-GumperzWilson1971) [1971](#source-GumperzWilson1971)), and [Kulkarni-Joshi](#source-Kulkarni-Joshi2015) ([2015](#source-Kulkarni-Joshi2015)) notes a local variety of Kannada was spoken by the Muslims and Hindus. The analyses by Guperz, Wilson, and Kulkarni-Joshi is that religious identity and the private sphere primarily informed language choice in Kupwar in he 1950s and 60s, with profession and work being highly correlated with religion and caste.
