# Overview Questionnaire

Authors: Eri Kashima and Kaius Sinnem√§ki


## Goal

The Overview Questionnaire is designed to gain a macro-perspective of the Focus Group society. The questions in this questionnaire were chosen to capture variables that could not captured in the Domains Questionnaire. The variables in this questionnaire were also chosen so that answers could be matched to prior studies investigating correlations between linguistic and macro socio-cultural factors.

Some of the questions, particularly those pertaining to demographics, may be difficult to answer without conducting specific research. If this is the case, please answer to the best of your knowledge, and provide details on sources which we can consult to gather more accurate data.
