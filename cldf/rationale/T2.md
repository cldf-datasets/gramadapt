# T2: What language do Neighbour Group adults typically speak to Focus Group children in domain X?

Authors: Francesca Di Garbo
- The Focus Group language
- The Neighbour Group language
- Some other language
- This is highly contextual

## Goal

This question aims to capture the extent to which interactional dynamics in this domain affect transmission. We are interested in the type of exposure a child may have to the language of the Neighbour Group through interactions with adult members of the community. If Focus Group children have the potential to learn a Neighbour Group Language in a particular social domain, we may surmise that the Focus Group and Neighbour Group have a high degree of contact where there are transmission opportunities for the Neighbour Group language.
