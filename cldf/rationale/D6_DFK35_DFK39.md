# D6: Post-Marriage Residency Practices (DFK35, DFK39)

Authors: Eri Kashima
e.g. What is the typical pattern of relocation for Focus Group women when starting a new family?

- Focus Group women practically always relocate to Neighbour Group locations
- Focus Group women often relocate to Neighbour Group locations
- Focus Group women sometimes relocate to Neighbour Group locations
- Focus Group women rarely relocate to Neighbour Group locations
- Focus Group women practically never relocate to Neighbour Group locations

## Goal

This question is related to post-marital residential practices. While there are a variety of residential practices that exist in the world, for the purposes of this questionnaire we look at patrilocal practices vs other forms.


## Definitions

*Patrilocal post-marital residency pattern*: where a wife moves to be with the husband once married.


## Examples

- *Focus/Neighbour Group women practically always relocate at Neighbour/Focus Group location*: Tariano (Arawak; Brazil/Colombia) speaking women who marrying Wanano (Tucanoan; Brazil/Colombia) speaking men will live in their husband’s village ([Chernela](#source-Chernela2013) [2013](#source-Chernela2013)). Idi (Pahoturi River; Papua New Guinea) speaking women who marry Nen (Yam; Papua New Guinea) speaking men will live in their husband’s village ([Evans](#source-Evans2012) [2012](#source-Evans2012)).
- *Focus Group women sometimes relocate to Neighbour Group locations:* These answer options may include cases of matrilocality where the husband relocates (e.g. Hopi (USA), [Eggan](#source-Eggan1950) [1950](#source-Eggan1950)), or ambilocality where the husband pays conjugal visits to his wife in her household/village (e.g. Na (Sino-Tibetan; China) speakers used to practice *tisese* “walking back and forth” visiting system where husbands would pay conjugal visits to their wives households and villages ([Shih](#source-Shih2010) [2010](#source-Shih2010); c.f. [Stanford et al.](#source-StanfordEtAl2018) [2018](#source-StanfordEtAl2018)))

## Theoretical Support & Examples

The reason for looking at patrilocal practices vs. other forms is twofold. Firstly, it appears that the most common pattern of post-marital residence pattern after marriage is where a wife moves to be with the husband or husband’s mother’s brother’s household (862/1267 = 68% according to the variable EA011: “Transfer of residence at marriage: prevailing pattern” at D-Place, https://d-place.org/parameters/EA011#1/30/153).

Secondly, sociolinguistic descriptions from parts of the world with high levels of linguistic diversity and multilingualism note how women marrying into a community that “does not speak her language” will have children who have some kind of multilingual capacity. There are reports of children with passive multilingualism (Sui, China as described by [Stanford](#source-Stanford2009a) [2009a](#source-Stanford2009a); 2009b), receptive multilingualism (Mawng speakers in Yolngu-matha Australia, [Singer](#source-Singer2018) [2018](#source-Singer2018)), active multilingualism in Nen and Idi (Papua New Guinea, [Evans](#source-Evans2012) [2012](#source-Evans2012)). Researchers analyse the language ideologies of the community as largely affecting the multilingualism of children. These ideologies appear to be associated with the geographical location of residence (e.g. a child should speak the language of their patriline and patrilineal place as in the Sui case; a woman should speak the language of her husband’s place as in the Papua case). The suggestion from such research is that the wife-to-husband relocation plays a role in creating/maintaining a linguistic environment that fosters multilingual speech on a daily basis.
