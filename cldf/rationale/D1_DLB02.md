## Goal

In this question we wish to know whether economic activity can be characterised as leaning towards subsistence, or towards large-scale wealth generation. These in turn may tell us something about interactional norms among the people who work in these different modes.


## Definitions and Examples

- *Public mode of production:* where there is a split between the public and private domains, and the individual goes out to the public domain to sell his/her labour. The work does not directly benefit the worker.
- *Domestic mode of production*: work activity, production, and consumption all occur at the household, family, or local community level. This mode of labour is often characterised as “free” under Western economic orthodoxy.
Note that "people" may include children in some contact situations.

The scale used is as follows:

- *Very commonly*: Work surrounding public modes of production is common enough for the majority of adults. Public modes of work are unremarked upon, is an experience shared by a majority of people. This is the widespread norm in e.g. contemporary WEIRD societies where the majority of adults are involved in salaried work.
- *Commonly*: Work surrounding public modes of production is common enough that it is not remarked upon much, but maybe limited to certain subsets of the population (e.g. only men work).
- *Somewhat commonly*: Work surrounding public modes of production is uncommon, and is an experience that is restricted to a minority of the population.
- *Uncommonly*: Work surrounding public modes of production is very rare, such that it is remarked upon. For example, in modern-day southern New Guinea, a handful of adults are salaried teachers but the vast majority of adults do not receive a salary of any kind and are subsistence horticulturalists.
- *Very uncommonly*: There is no work surrounding public modes of production.

## Theoretical & Empirical Support

Workplaces of the public mode of labour are often stratified, which tends to result in differential linguistic behaviour and variation in linguistic forms among workers (e.g. [Leach](#source-Leach2018) [2018](#source-Leach2018) on industrial vs managerial workers in the pottery industry in the UK). Collective work in factories that pull people from other parts of the world report cases where workers are not necessarily able to communicate with the employer or with their colleagues (e.g. [Premji et al.](#source-PremjiEtAl2008) [2008](#source-PremjiEtAl2008) on a factory in Montreal, Canada). In such multilingual settings, it tends to be that many workers have more frequent contact with those who shared a first language other than that of the majority or with speakers with very different styles and varieties of this majority language (e.g. [Goldstein](#source-Goldstein1997) [1997](#source-Goldstein1997); [Clyne](#source-Clyne1994) [1994](#source-Clyne1994) on Melbourne, Australia; and [Duff et al.](#source-DuffEtAl2000) [2000](#source-DuffEtAl2000) on Canada). While we have not investigated it specifically, research into ways of speaking and interaction in private modes of labour likely exist but in small quantities.

Macro studies which investigate language change and diversity sometimes include subsistence patterns and economies of production (e.g. [Derungs et al.](#source-DerungsEtAl2018) [2018](#source-DerungsEtAl2018)), and this is done for seemingly two related reasons. One reason is that there is a tacit understanding by linguists that groups will organise themselves differently according to the needs of differing modes of production, which then have consequences for social structure, behaviour, and linguistic interaction (e.g. [Epps](#source-Epps2017) [2017](#source-Epps2017)). The idea that, for example, peoples of rice-growing societies, wheat-growing societies, and hunter-gatherer societies have behaviour patterns that differ from one another is a relatively old observation ([Berry](#source-Berry1967) [1967](#source-Berry1967)). Another reason why subsistence is thought to have consequences is that different patterns of subsistence might overlap with environmental productivity and other geographical and climatic factors that affect peoples' behaviours and social structures (the relationship between geographical-climatic factors and languages is, however, not straight forward, see [Collard & Foley](#source-CollardFoley2002) [2002](#source-CollardFoley2002); [Gavin & Sibanda](#source-GavinSibanda2012) [2012](#source-GavinSibanda2012); [Coelho et al.](#source-CoelhoEtAl2019) [2019](#source-CoelhoEtAl2019)).This falls under the Ecological Risk Hypothesis ([Nettle](#source-Nettle1999) [1999](#source-Nettle1999)).
