Possible response:
- Yes
- No

## Goal

In this question we wish to know whether language is stated as some kind of emblem of group identity.


## Definitions

- *Relationships of descent*: A group based on emically defined ways of grouping people who share ancestry and kin. Publications may refer to these groups variously as clans, kinship groups, descent groups, lineage groups, house systems.
- *Race, ethnicity*: A difference based on perceived physical differences, often overlapping with perceived cultural and linguistic differences. Emic commentary on this category often mentions these perceived physical differences, along with identification of difference in some of the following: economic system, wealth, primary subsistence pattern, major staple crop, belief system
- *Local geographical or territorial group*: A group based on local geographical or territorial organization, such as a village, region, neighbourhood, or tribe, but not based on shared ancestry or kinship.
- *Macro-level (politico-)territorial group:* A macro-level group category that supersedes other levels of grouping, such as kin, and local community. The group as a collective has some kind of jurisdictional power, such as exerting punishment for transgressions, and the ability to declare warfare upon other politico-territorial groups.
- *Formal or informal relationships between non-kin*: Identities based on relationship ties rather than those of group membership. Such as alliances, sodality membership, ad-hoc relationships between families or individuals.

## Theoretical & Empirical Support

Language is often a marker of some form of identity. Speakers'/signers' linkage of language and identities may be strong, such as in numerous pre-colonial Australian Indigenous contexts ([Merlan](#source-Merlan1981) [1981](#source-Merlan1981)), parts of Melanesia ([Grace](#source-Grace1975) [1975](#source-Grace1975), [Laycock](#source-Laycock1982) [1982](#source-Laycock1982)), and in European Romanticism ([Bauman & Briggs](#source-BaumanBriggs2000) [2000](#source-BaumanBriggs2000)). The relationship between language and identity can also be secondary, or absent from speaker's conscious reporting (e.g. [Khanina](#source-Khanina2021) [2021](#source-Khanina2021) for northern Siberia). The ubiquitous relating between language and identity has led to investigations concerning the evolutionary functions of language as markers of identities ([Moya](#source-Moya2013) [2013](#source-Moya2013), c.f. [Moya and Henrich](#source-MoyaHenrich2016) [2016](#source-MoyaHenrich2016)).

The above types of identities were chosen for the questionnaire based on the numerous works recurrently showing the relevance of these categories to language variation and change. These particular social factors were identified for the Overview Questionnaire as they frequently appear as factors linking language and identity at gross level, rather than identities within a broadly construed language community. The reason may be because the relationship between identity and language variation is about a social group exercising agency and power (e.g. [Bucholtz and Hall](#source-BucholtzHall2004) [2004](#source-BucholtzHall2004): 371), and the identification of a group via language leads to perceived or real gains of socio(-political) agency and power.

For works overviewing and discussing identity:

- Race, ethnicity: [Wolfram](#source-Wolfram1969) [1969](#source-Wolfram1969), [Hewitt](#source-Hewitt) [1986](#source-Hewitt), c.f. [Omoniyi](#source-Omoniyi2020) [2020](#source-Omoniyi2020).
- Local geographical or territorial group: c.f. [Reed](#source-Reed2020) [2020](#source-Reed2020), c.f. [Johnstone](#source-Johnstone2010) [2010](#source-Johnstone2010).
- Macro (politico-)territorial group: language, ethnicity, and nationalism c.f. [Lytra](#source-Lytra2020) [2020](#source-Lytra2020); see [Gooskens and Kürschner](#source-GooskensKurschner2009) [2009](#source-GooskensKurschner2009) on effects of national borders on language change.
- Formal or informal relationships between non-kin:  c.f. [King](#source-King2019) [2019](#source-King2019) on communities of practice in variationism.

The connection between language and identity is thought to play a role in language variation and change in a number of ways:
- It may form a psychological boundary between languages, enforcing a linguistic boundary between linguistic codes in speakers' minds. This may, for example, maintain the separation of parts of linguistic codes in multilingual/language contact situations ([François](#source-Francois2012) [2012](#source-Francois2012)), and even contribute to language differentiation ([Irvine and Gal](#source-IrvineGal2000) [2000](#source-IrvineGal2000)).
- It may enforce norms within a language ([Milroy & Margrain](#source-MilroyMargrain1980) [1980](#source-MilroyMargrain1980)) and may hinder language shift speakers/signers assume a positive self identity that is tied to language ([Giles & Johnson](#source-GilesJohnson1987) [1987](#source-GilesJohnson1987)).

The exact role of identity as a causal factor in language change is debated. [Labov](#source-Labov2001) ([2001](#source-Labov2001)) expresses skepticism that the concept of local identity motivates language change (p.191). [Mufwene](#source-Mufwene2001) ([2001](#source-Mufwene2001)) suggests that speakers of creoles do not create languages but that creoles emerge from linguistic production without intention. [Trudgill](#source-Trudgill2008) ([2008](#source-Trudgill2008)) argues that European colonial varieties such as Brazillian Portugese and New Zealand English emerge from dialect mixture rather than from a desire to mark out a new national identity.

The causal role of identity in language variation and change is perhaps causal only under specific circumstances. The relationship between language and identity is fluid, and the causal effect of identity on language variation and change will vary by place and time.
