> [!NOTE]
> The formulation of this question is slightly different in the questionnaire: "Have there been any natural disasters or major societal upheaval during the densest period of contact between the Focus language speaking and Neighbour language speaking people, such it impacted people's mobility, and Focus language speaking people talk about it?"
## Goal

This question seeks information about the occurrence of any societal upheaval or natural disaster that has impacted people's mobility. In other words, we are interested whether such abrupt causes may have influenced the Focus group's contact with the Neighbour group in any way.

## Possible Response

- Yes
- No

## Theoretical & Empirical Support

Famines, wars, natural disasters, or major societal upheavals usually impact people's mobility in significant ways when people leave their home regions in search for food or shelter. Disasters of this kind may result in loss of linguistic diversity owing to depopulation and to people migrating and shifting to another language. If the migrating people shift to another language, this may also lead to simplification of the successor language's grammar, as could be hypothesized when one language community absorbs a large number of newcomers who learn the language as a non-native language (e.g., [Trudgill](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Trudgill2011) [2011](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Trudgill2011)). At the least, significant mobility typically breaks social networks and may affect how linguistic variants diffuse in the population.

As an example, [Grünthal et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:gruenthal2022a) ([2022](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:gruenthal2022a): see Supplement S9 and references there) discuss the medieval Black Death in Europe. This bubonic plague pandemic had drastic societal effects because of the large-scale loss of lives. Undoubtedly, the pandemic had also significant effects on language ecologies across Europe. A number of researchers have discussed, for instance, whether the inflectional system of Norwegian may have simplified owing to the sociolinguistic causes of the pandemic (e.g., [Jahr](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:jahr1999a) [1999](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:jahr1999a); [Mæhlum](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:m2000a) [2000](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:m2000a); [Askedal](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:askedal2005a) [2005](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:askedal2005a)). Howerver, no systematic research has yet been done on the possible linguistic outcomes of the Black Death.

[Grünthal et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:gruenthal2022a) ([2022](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:gruenthal2022a): e.g. 498-500) further argue that the rapid spread of the Uralic people was caused by a catastrophic climate change 3800 to 4200 years ago. This event, known in the Earth sciences as the 4.2 ka event, led to global cooling, greater precipitation in northwest Eurasia, and drought in some continental interiors. These conditions seem to have led to greater opportunities for riverine hunter-fisherers (i.e. Uralic people) who spread rapidly West of Urals and created a large trade-network.

While societal upheaval or natural disaster may sometimes be the only contributing factor to large-scale mobility, often there is no single cause but several factors involved. For instance, the rapid spread of the Slavs in different parts of Europe may have been caused by two factors operating around the same time (see [Lindstedt and Salmela](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:lindstedt2020a) [2020](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:lindstedt2020a)). First, the Late Antique Little Ice Age in the 6th and 7th centuries cooled climate, probably as a result of volcanic eruptions in the early 6th century. This climate change caused farmers to migrate and seek more favorable conditions for agriculture elsewhere. Second, the Plague of Justinian in the 6th to 8th centuries resulted in the death of about 25-50 million people in the Byzantine Empire alone, causing the depopulation of farming communities across the Balkans and the ensuing spread of the Slavs there.
