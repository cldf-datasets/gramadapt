- *Highly Mixed*
## Goal

The purpose of this question is to broadly characterise the dominant form of subsistence of Focus Group society.


## Definitions

- *Hunter-gatherer:* Dependence on the gathering of wild plants, and land fauna relative to other subsistence activities.
- *Fishing:* Dependence on fishing, including shellfishing and the pursuit of large aquatic animals, relative to other subsistence activities.
- *Animal husbandry:* Dependence on animal husbandry, relative to other subsistence activities.
- *Agricultural, casual:* Dependence on low-intensity agriculture. Slight or sporadic cultivation of food or other plants incidental to a primary dependence upon other subsistence practices
- *Agricultural, shifting:* Dependence on semi-intensive agriculture. New fields are cleared up to every few years, cultivated for a few years, and then allowed to revert to forest or brush for a long fallow period
- *Agricultural, permanent:* Dependence on intensive agriculture. Permanent fields utilising technologies such as fertilisation and irrigation.
- *Highly Mixed:* A near-equal distribution of subsistence patterns


The categories are adapted from the variables EA001, EA002, EA003, EA004, and EA028 in the Ethnographic Atlas ([Gray](#source-Gray1999) [1999](#source-Gray1999); [Murdock et al.](#source-MurdockEtAl1999) [1999](#source-MurdockEtAl1999)). All variables are available at D-Place (https://d-place.org/; [Kirby et al.](#source-KirbyEtAl2016) [2016](#source-KirbyEtAl2016); 2018b). The category of *Agricultural, permanent* includes both “Intensive” and “Intensive irrigated” categories of EA028.


## Examples

- Hunter-gatherer: The entry for Chamacoco society (Chamacoco, Zamucoan; Paraguay) in D-Place lists subsistence as 56–65% gathering and 36–45% hunting.
- Fishing: The entry for Manus society (Titan, Austronesian; Papua New Guinea) in D-Place lists subsistence as 86–100% fishing.
- Animal husbandry: The entry for Midobi society (Midob, Nubian; Sudan) in D-Place lists subsistence as 86-100% animal husbandry.
- Agricultural, Casual: The entry for Yakut (Sakha, Turkic; Russia) in D-Place lists subsistence as casual agriculture, with animal husbandry, fishing, hunting, and gathering accounting for the rest of the subsistence pattern.
- Agricultural, Shifting: The entry for Bribri society (Bribri, Chibchan; Panama) in D-Place as lists subsistence as dominantly shifting agriculture, with fishing, gathering, and hunting accounting for the rest of the subsistence pattern.
- Agricultural, Permanent: The entry for Catawba society (Catawba, Siouan; United States of America) in D-Place lists subsistence as 66–75% intensive agriculture.
- Highly mixed: The entry for Selkup society (Selkup, Uralic; Russia) in D-Place lists subsistence as 36–45% animal husbandry, and 36–45% as fishing.

## Theoretical & Empirical Support

Subsistence patterns have at times been treated as representative of certain kinds of mobility patterns, which have consequences for interactions on many fronts. For example, food production strategies of subsistence such as agriculture, are able to sustain higher density populations. On the other hand, hunter-gatherers and pastoralists need to travel wider distances to support their substance patterns (). The hypothesis that peoples, and languages, spread out from an agricultural heartland due to the uptake of agricultural practices is epitomised in the farming dispersal hypothesis (summary in [Bellwood](#source-Bellwood2005) [2005](#source-Bellwood2005)). While there are critiques concerning conceptualisations found within this hypothesis (e.g. [Janowski](#source-Janowski2007) [2007](#source-Janowski2007)), we have nonetheless decided to follow the tradition of macro-areal studies by investigating subsistence pattern as a variable.

Other suggestions in the literature link subsistence patterns with behavioural characteristics. It has been suggested that adults in “low food accumulation” societies (hunter-gatherers, foragers) tend to be “individualistic, assertive, and venturesome” compared to adults of “high food accumulation societies” ([Berry](#source-Berry1967) [1967](#source-Berry1967); [Diamond](#source-Diamond1997) [1997](#source-Diamond1997)). Rice-growing societies of China were found to be more collectivistic than wheat-growing ones ([Talhelm et al.](#source-TalhelmEtAl2014) [2014](#source-TalhelmEtAl2014), however see [Roberts](#source-Roberts2015) [2015](#source-Roberts2015) for caution in accepting Talhelm et al.’s results). If there are indeed behavioural characteristics associated with subsistence patterns, we may find some evidence that links subsistence patterns with linguistic adaptation.
