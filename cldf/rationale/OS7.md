# OS7: What is the mean size of Focus Group communities at the local level?

Authors: Kaius Sinnemäki

- *Fewer than 50 persons*
- *From 50 to 99 persons*
- *From 100 to 199 persons*
- *From 200 to 399 persons*
- *From 400 to 1,000 persons*
- *More than 1,000 persons in the absence of indigenous urban aggregations*
- *One or more indigenous towns of more than 5,000 inhabitants but none of more than 50,000*
## Goal

Answers to this question will help to better characterise the large-scale demographic data collected at the beginning of the questionnaire.


## Definitions

*Community at the local level* refers to residential communities, such as hamlets, villages, and towns, and not to networks of social interaction. However, it gives us a population index that is closer to social networks than to the size of the total population.

The scale is as follows:

- Fewer than 50 persons
- From 50 to 99 persons
- From 100 to 199 persons
- From 200 to 399 persons
- From 400 to 1,000 persons
- More than 1,000 persons in the absence of indigenous urban aggregations
- One or more indigenous towns of more than 5,000 inhabitants but none of more than 50,000


This question and possible answers are the same as in the question EA031 in The Ethnographic Atlas ([Gray](#source-Gray1999) [1999](#source-Gray1999); [Murdock et al.](#source-MurdockEtAl1999) [1999](#source-MurdockEtAl1999)). Variable EA031 can be found in D-PLACE ([Kirby et al.](#source-KirbyEtAl2016) [2016](#source-KirbyEtAl2016); [Kirby et al.](#source-KirbyEtAl2018a) [2018](#source-KirbyEtAl2018a); see https://d-place.org/parameters/EA031).


## Examples

- The entry for Nganasan society (Nganasan, Uralic; Russian Federation) in D-Place lists the mean size of local communities as less then 50 persons.
- The entry for Lozi society (Lozi, Atlantic-Congo; Zambia) in D-Place lists the mean size of local communities as 50–99 persons.
- The entry for Ticuna society (Ticuna, Ticuna-Yuri; Colombia) in D-Place lists the mean size of local communities as 100–199 persons.
- The entry for Mekeo society (Mekeo, Austronesian; Papua New Guinea) in D-Place lists the mean size of local communities as 200–399 persons.
- The entry for Hano society (Arizona Tewa, Kiowa-Tanoan; United States of America) in D-Place lists the mean size of local communities as 400–1,000 persons.
- The entry for Mam society (Mam, Mayan; Guatemala) in D-Place lists the mean size of local communities as more than 1,000 persons without indigenous urban aggregations.
- The entry for Jebala society (Jebli, Afro-Asiatic; Morocco) in D-Place lists the mean size of local communities as 5,000–50,000 persons.

## Theoretical Support

Humans arrange themselves socially in fairly small populations. [Dunbar](#source-Dunbar1993) ([1993](#source-Dunbar1993)) shows that human social groups tend to be between 100 and 250 persons, averaging to 150 individuals. Such groups are maintained by interaction of sufficiently regular basis that the social bonds are based on direct personal knowledge. Social groups can be larger but then there's a need for intermediating authorities within the group; otherwise social cohesion could not be maintained and the group would disperse ([Dunbar](#source-Dunbar1993) [1993](#source-Dunbar1993): 686–687).
