## Goal

This question tries to capture the degree of formalization of exchange practices. Ceremonial exchanges are highly ritualised performative acts, and, as such, they are characterised by rules of behaviour, including linguistic behaviour, that are also highly conventionalised. For instance, different speech styles (e.g. monologic, dialogic, sung speech) may be associated with different phases of a ceremonial exchange ritual (cf. the description of the *po’oa* ceremony in the examples section, based on [Chernela](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Chernela2003) [2003](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Chernela2003)). Conversely, we surmise that gift exchanges, which result from the initiative of the individual may be less formalised from the point of view of associated linguistic interactions.

With this question we also aim at capturing the intensity of contact between Focus Group and Neighbour Group through practices of exchange. The higher the number of exchange practices between the groups, the greater the possibilities of interaction, hence the degree of contact. We may also assume that in communities where exchange across groups is only ceremonial, contact in this domain is less pervasive than in communities where, say, individual gift exchange also occurs across groups.
## Definitions

The scale is as follows:

- Is Exchange between Focus and Neighbour Group the individual’s initiative?
- Is Exchange between Focus and Neighbour Group an institutionalised procedure?
- Is Exchange between Focus and Neighbour Group part of a ceremonial event to which both communities participate?

## Examples

- YES for *individual initiative*: Most gift exchanges in contemporary WEIRD societies are the result of the initiative of individuals acting within their private sphere, but they are also tied to social norms and expectations that are widely shared in the community(-ies) of reference ([Yan](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Yan2012) [2012](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Yan2012)). Examples of these are birthday gifts and engagement ring giving.
- YES for *institutionalised procedure*: The *kula* is an example of institutionalised exchange*.*The *kula* is a complex system of exchange among the inhabitants of the Trobriand Islands of Papua New Guinea. It is centred around the circulation of armshells for necklaces and plays a crucial role in regulating alliances and circulation of goods between the islands. As institutionalised in the wider community network as it may be, the *kula* also remains “competitive enterprise wherein individuals act as free agents” ([Yan](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Yan2012) [2012](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Yan2012): 276).
- YES for *ceremonial exchange:* The *po’oa* is a traditional exchange ceremony among Eastern Tucanoan groups in the Vaupés (Northwestern Amazonia), which is carried out among intermarrying groups in order to celebrate a diverse range of rites of passages, such as puberty rites, marriage, naming. The ceremony is a gathering between different sib settlements, each of which is associated with a different language by virtue of patrilineal descent. The event is organised around various types of exchange, which also include highly conventionalised language exchanges, such as salutations, sung speeches or oratory ([Chernela](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Chernela2003) [2003](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Chernela2003)).
