## Goal
This question has the same goals as those of CID I2 and DFK09; that is, this question is asking about the input a Focus Group person receives from Neighbour Group people. In this instance we are specifically interested in the input from one's Neighbour Group in-laws.

We may surmise that if a Focus Group are exposed to the Neighbour Group language through this domain, they will have opportunities to comprehend or produce the Neighbour language. It is also an indirect measure of asymmetries characterising the contact situation. For instance, if, on average, Neighbour Group people are likely to use the Focus Group language in interactions with Focus Group people, this can be an indication of contextual and/or more fundamental asymmetries in the social dynamics between the two groups within the contact situation at stake.
## Definitions

- *Very well*: Focus Group people have high comprehension skills of Neighbour Group language & understand the contextual situation very well
- *Well*: Focus Group people have low comprehension skills of Neighbour Group language but understand the contextual situation very well.
- *Somewhat*: Focus Group people have low comprehension skills of Neighbour Group language but understand the contextual situation to some xtent.
- *Poorly*: Focus Group people have low comprehension skills of Neighbour Group language and do not understand the contextual situation too well either
- *Very poorly*

## Theoretical Support
For theoretical and empirical support regarding in-put comprehension and language learning, see I2.

We identify in-law relations specifically as this is a relationship that can be linguistically marked as socially significant.  Descriptive works note the importance of these relationships on linguistic behaviour. There are often strong social obligations between in-laws, which seems to result in strong imperatives for audience design and stance taking. (See DFK38)
