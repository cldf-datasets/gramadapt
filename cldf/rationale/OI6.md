# OI6: What are the Focus Group speakers' attitudes towards linguistic transfers from the Neighbour Group, such as lexical or grammatical borrowing?

Authors: Kaius Sinnemäki

- Very negative
- Negativ
- Neither positive nor negative
- Negative
- Very positive

## Goal

With this question we ask about Focus Group speakers' attitudes towards linguistic transfer from Neighbour Group. However, this attitude may differ from Focus Group speakers' attitudes towards linguistic transfer in general (that is, from any other language) - a question we ask in [OI7](OI7.md) below.


## Definitions

- *Very negative:* transfer of linguistic items is highly stigmatised, frowned upon, or thought threatening to linguistic purity, for instance.
- *Neither positive nor negative:* neutral attitude towards linguistic transfer: no clear opinion, indifference.
- *Very positive:* linguistic transfer is highly valued, for instance, when young people borrow expressions from a prestige language.

## Theoretical & Empirical Support

Language attitudes play an important role in people's linguistic behaviour in language contact situations. If a group's attitude is indifferent or even favours linguistic transfer, this can lead to extensive lexical and even grammatical borrowing. For instance, [Law](#source-Law2014) 's ([2014](#source-Law2014); see also the discussion in [Rodríguez-Ordóñez](#source-Rodriguez-Ordonez2019) [2019](#source-Rodriguez-Ordonez2019)) studies of the related Mayan languages in Guatemala, Mexico, and Belize suggested that the contact situations had resulted in significant convergence, restructuring, and even borrowing of whole morphological paradigms under language contact. The attitude of Maya Lowlanders was perhaps not outright positive towards transfer but there was sufficient indifference for extensive linguistic transfer to take place. On the other hand, the vibrant social contact between Uruguyan Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese in the border communities of Brazil and Uruguay has not led to extensive linguistic transfer because of the prevailing linguistic ideology of standard national languages (e.g. [Carvalho](#source-Carvalho2014) [2014](#source-Carvalho2014); see also the related discussion in [Rodríguez-Ordóñez](#source-Rodriguez-Ordonez2019) [2019](#source-Rodriguez-Ordonez2019)). The result is a stable multilingual community where the linguistic codes are kept quite strictly separate. The attitude towards linguistic transfer is thus viewed negatively.

If the attitudes are strong, it appears that bilingual speakers are capable of keeping lexicon and phonology quite distinct in the languages in contact. Speakers are generally less aware of morphosyntax and therefore it is possible that even strong language attitudes cannot keep grammar distinct in the languages in contact.
