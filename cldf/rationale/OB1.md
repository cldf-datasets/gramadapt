# OB1: Is there an emic conception of Focus Group as “a language” or some other categorical or objective thing? 

Authors: Eri Kashima
- *Yes*
- *No*


## Goal

This question intends to identify whether a group conceptualises ways of speaking a certain way as a reified "language".


## Definitions

emic = a locally understood; as perceived by community insiders


## Examples

A prototypical example of language ideologies of reification are nationalist linkages between language, nation, and people.

Reification of languages are also attested non-nationalist frames of meaning. Pakedorf et. al (2021) have noted that linguistic reification in small-scale multilingual societies is often spatially and/or politically anchored (p.839). A local place may be viewed as having a language, or being strongly associated with a  language. Either way there appears to be some kind of imagined idea of (a) way of speaking.

## Theoretical Support

Particular uses of the notion translanguaging take the theoretical stance that bilinguals who speak/sign multiple languages have an internally undifferentiated and unitary linguistic system, therefore that  ‘languages’	have no linguistic or cognitive reality (as pointed out by [Cummins](#source-Cummins2021) [2021](#source-Cummins2021) and others). Many argue that this is empirically untrue. For example an fMRI study by Abutelebi et al. (2008) demonstrate that German-French bilingual speakers mobilise different areas of the brain in order to inhibit the effects of the other language when speaking one. As [Cummins](#source-Cummins2021) ([2021](#source-Cummins2021)) points out, there appears to be a conflation of fluidity in utilising multilingual repertoires in practice, with the idea that this reflects a cognitive reality: "The hybridity	of linguistic practices	and the	complexity	of linguistic repertoires	‘do	not	carry	the	consequence that languages	do	not	exist	or that	named	languages	are	irrelevant’ (Grin,	2018:	257)."

The lack of cross-linguistic investigation into the question of whether communities objectify ways of speaking (as "languages" or something similar) prompted us to include this question in the questionnaire.
