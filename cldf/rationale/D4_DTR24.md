Typically when trading with Neighbour Group, the Focus Group people will
## Answer Options

- Use money
- Exchange objects
- This is contextual
## Goal

The aim of this question is to find out whether money is used in trade, or not.
## Definitions

For the purposes of this question, money is understood as a standardised system of exchange regulated by some centralised group with authority (typically a state), and employs tokens to represent the value of goods and services. Coinage is the prototypical form of money.

Barter is defined as "a complementary exchange in which each participant bargains until he or she is satisfied" (following Humphrey 1985:49)
## Examples

Given that there are no known societies that rely purely on barter ([Humphrey](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Humphrey1985) [1985](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Humphrey1985)) or money, we ask respondents to consider the typicality of money/object exchange in the acquisition of goods and services between the Focus and Neighbour groups.

- A group that typically makes payments without negotiation of price should be considered "use money".
- A group that typically barters, and uses cash as a means of bargaining, will be considered "exchange objects".
- This is contextual: Any group that has a strong mix of the above two modes.
## Theoretical & Empirical Support

The use of money, and monetary systems for trade, tell us a few things.
The wide-spread use of currency suggests that a group participates in a system of payment where the value of money is defined, guaranteed, and accepted by some centralised authority ([Orrell & Chlupatý](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:OrrellChlupaty2016) [2016](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:OrrellChlupaty2016): 21). The mode of payment may be coinage, or a state-backed system of credit.

The use of currencies vs barter as a primary means may suggest certain kinds of interactions and linguistic exchanges. Experimental evidence suggests that the use of cash results in more solitary and individualistic behaviours ([Vohs et al.](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:VohsEtAl2006) [2006](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:VohsEtAl2006)), which may in turn have consequences for interactions and linguistic norms. Unlike the use of cash which raises the possibility of interaction between strangers, barter tends to take place between people who know one another ([Humphrey](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Humphrey1985) [1985](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Humphrey1985)). Although barter almost always co-exists alongside the use of money ([Humphrey & Hugh-Jones](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Humphrey_Hugh-Jones_1992) [1992](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Humphrey_Hugh-Jones_1992), [Davies](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Davies2002) [2002](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Davies2002): 11–13), if a group mostly barters, this type of exchange probably involves intimates, and a higher degree of linguistic interaction associated with the notion of a society of intimates ([Givón & Young](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:GivonYoung2002) [2002](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:GivonYoung2002), [Trudgill](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Trudgill2011) [2011](sources.bib?ref&with_internal_ref_link&keep_label#cldf:Trudgill2011)).
