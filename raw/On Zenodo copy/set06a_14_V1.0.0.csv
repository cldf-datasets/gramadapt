However, statistics and testimonies for the Sicilian period are scarce, with the result that most of my responses to the questionnaire concern the present time period (roughly the last decades) when contact with Sicily is still ongoing, albeit in a much wider international framework.

The densest period of time for contact between Malta and Sicily was from 1050 to around 1550, because political, social and economic ties were practically exclusive. From 1550 onwards such contacts with Italy increased, and ties with the UK began in 1800 but became strong from about 1850 and are strongest today. However, statistics and testimonies for the Sicilian period are scarce, with the result that most of my responses to the questionnaire concern the present time period (roughly the last decades) when contact with Sicily is still ongoing, albeit in a much wider international framework. As regards language, contact with Sicilian died out with the coming of the Knights of St John who introduced Italian, both as an official and a spoken language for the educated classes.

The densest period of time for contact between Malta and Sicily was from 1050 to around 1550, because political, social and economic ties were practically exclusive. From 1550 onwards such contacts with Italy increased, and ties with the UK began in 1800 but became strong from about 1850 and are strongest today. However, statistics and testimonies for the Sicilian period are scarce, with the result that most of my responses to the questionnaire concern the present time period (roughly the last decades) when contact with Sicily is still ongoing, albeit in a much wider international framework. As regards language, contact with Sicilian died out with the coming of the Knights of St John who introduced Italian, both as an official and a spoken language for the educated classes.

The densest period of time for contact between Malta and Sicily was from 1050 to around 1550, because political, social and economic ties were practically exclusive. From 1550 onwards such contacts with Italy increased, and ties with the UK began in 1800 but became strong from about 1850 and are strongest today. However, statistics and testimonies for the Sicilian period are scarce, with the result that most of my responses to the questionnaire concern the present time period (roughly the last decades) when contact with Sicily is still ongoing, albeit in a much wider international framework. As regards language, contact with Sicilian died out with the coming of the Knights of St John who introduced Italian, both as an official and a spoken language for the educated classes.
