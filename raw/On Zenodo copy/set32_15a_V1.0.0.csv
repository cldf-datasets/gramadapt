On the one hand, marriages between speakers of these two languages seem to reflect at least the groom's desire to interact with the bride (very little information exists about brides' perspectives on marriage). On the other hand, marriages involved a significant economic transaction and bride price was a significant factor in a family's social status, which may have created incentives other than personal enjoyment for some marriages. Because marriage exchanges between Yurok and Karuk people were neither required through exogamy, nor discouraged for social reasons, nor driven by specific subsistence needs or power imbalances, it is likely that these marriages were largely driven by the desire of individuals to spend time with one another and were thus somewhat friendly.",Hannah Haynie,DEM,2,Scalar,Friendly,Somewhat friendly,Neutral,Somewhat hostile,Hostile,NA,NA,NA,Haynie,Yurok,Yurok,yur,yuro1248,Karuk,Karok,kyh,karo1304,Yurok-Karok,yur-kyh,yuro1248-karo1304,California,OR

Exogamous marriage in general seems to make up a relatively small proportion of Yurok marriages (56 of 413 in Waterman and Kroeber's sample, or about 14%), likely due to the impact of geographic proximity on marital choices. Waterman and Kroeber report that a majority of the marriages involving Yurok men and non-Yurok women are full marriages in which the bride relocated to the groom's community, while almost half of the marriages between Yurok women and non-Yurok men were ""half marriages"" in which the women remained living with their families.

Similarly, family life is not described in great detail in the ethnographic literature. The limitations of documentary sources make it difficult to answer several of the questions in this section of the questionnaire.
Another complication in this discussion is the variability of marriage patterns, particularly with regard to post-marital residence. This is a key factor in understanding individual family dynamics and language use in families, but the existence of both patrilocal and matrilocal norms and the relatively even proportions of Yurok husband/Karuk wife and Karuk husband/Yurok wife marriages make it difficult to generalize about language use in families.",NA,Hannah Haynie,DFK,2,Comment,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Haynie,Yurok,Yurok,yur,yuro1248,Karuk,Karok,kyh,karo1304,Yurok-Karok,yur-kyh,yuro1248-karo1304,California,OR

Horticulture was historically practiced by the Yurok only to a limited extent, in the planting of tobacco. Because the primary subsistence and manufacturing activities of the Yurok relied heavily on individual labor, the domain of work is not a significant locus of social contact between Yurok and Karuk speakers, especially in comparison to societies in which the workplace serves as a center for second language acquisition and socialization.

Regarding gender, women and men traditionally carried out different subsistence activities and may have therefore interacted primarily with different segments of the local community. Women were prohibited from entering men's sweat houses. Certain occupations (e.g. healer) were restricted by gender. In short, there are many gender differences that shaped individuals' experiences in the local community. It is unclear, though, how these differences might have impacted language in Yurok communities.
An important distinction seems to have revolved around wealth. Wealthy families enjoyed a different lifestyles and greater community prestige than less wealthy families, and while Yurok wealth distinctions may not have been as formalized as class systems in many other human societies, they had significant consequences for community involvement. Wealthy families, for example, acted as hosts of ceremonial gatherings (see Kroeber 1925, 40 and Pilling 1978, 141). While participation at these community events was not limited based on wealth/incipient class or on the other characteristics enumerated above, the social position of wealthy individuals at these community gatherings would have differed from others in the community (e.g. in their provision of feasts and displays of wealth). Buckley (1984) describes two registers in Yurok, associated respectively with high and low class. The ""wo·ogey speech"" or high register was said by Buckley (1984) and Pilling (1978) to be used by wealthy families to index their high social status. Buckley describes this speech as involving more complex morphological, syntactic, and semantic structures than ordinary Yurok speech as well as differences in vowels and fricative consonants.

While Buckley describes some linguistic features of the aristocratic register, Pilling provides insufficient linguistic detail for comparison.

Ceremonies were organized by prominent family in each of several locations. Thus the participation of individuals in certain aspects of ritual life and knowledge transfer was linked by the same mechanism to social class, descent group, and place. The master/novice system described by Pilling (1978) was used to train the heads of a town's aristocratic household. While there was not a formalized distinction between life stages or ages, this system typically paired old men as masters with young men as novices. Gender also determined participation in the domain of ritual knowledge. While men played important roles in ceremonial gatherings (e.g. as priests reciting formulas or as hosts of gatherings), shamanism and ritual healing was the domain of women (Kroeber 1925).
