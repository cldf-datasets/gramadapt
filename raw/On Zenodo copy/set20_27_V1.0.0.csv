Some have also settled permanently in the southern parts of West Bengal where Bengali speaking people are the majority, say, Hooghly, Howrah, South 24-Parganas and Nadia districts.

Of the many tribal problems, the greatest of all is poverty. It is a historical reality. The central Indian tribal areas were inhabited by many tribes, especially the Santali people. The industrial invasion, especially after the independence of India in 1947 and reorganization of the state borders in 1956 many tribes had to be displaced in the name of development and better administration. As a result, the Santali people like many other tribes were dispersed in many states including predominantly Bengali speaking West Bengal. While their earlier settlements were typically inhabited by the tribals, especially the Santali people their new settlements were in the mixed zones, inhabited by both the Santali and non-Santali (here mostly Bengali) people.  As a result of their dispersal means of livelihood were severely affected and they had no other alternative but to sell their labour to non-Santali people (mostly Bengali people) in the neighbouring and far off areas within West Bengal. A tribe like the Santals became labours from hunter-gatherers, labours in the agricultural fields, rice mills, and recently in construction sites. The result was the emergence of contact situation. Moreover, for their needs they have to visit local shops and weekly markets owned and run by the Bengali people. In schools and colleges, the Santali children, boys and girls have to mix and interact with the Bengali boys and girls as the schools and colleges enroll both Bengali and Santali wards, except a handful tribal schools which are meant for the tribal students. Hence outside their home domain they always have to interact with the Bengali people for any kind of engagement. Language Contact is therefore the norm and bilingualism and sometimes trilingualism is regular among the Santals. Though bi-/trilingualism is rampant it does not necessarily lead to language shift and that can be illustrated by the decennial growth of Santali speakers in West Bengal, as also in India. this type of bi-/trilingualism is described as 'non-competing and non-conflicting type of grass-root bilingualism' (Srivastava 1977) or 'functional bilingualism' (Abbi 1986) Actually in a multilingual country like India where bi-/multilingualism is the norm contact does not necessarily create a hindrance to language maintenance as here 'language maintenance is the norm and shift is an exception' (Pandit 1977:9)",NA,Arun Ghosh,DLB,1,Comment,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Ghosh,Santali,Santali,sat,sant1410,Bengali,Bengali,ben,beng1280,Santali - Bengali,sat-ben,sant14140-beng1280,Indic,OR

This event left an indelible impact in the mind of the Santali people and the Santali society as a whole became aware of the importance of their own language and education. They started sending their wards to the schools in large numbers which are also attended by the Bengali boys and girls. Around the same time the Santali people started entering politics in significant numbers as they thought the communist government (Left front government assumed office in 1978 in West Bengal) would address their grievances sincerely. A sense of belonging grew among them. They thought education would help them eradicate their poverty and superstition and they can also contribute in nation building. The Santali language was recognized in the 8th schedule of the Constitution of India in 2003 by the government of India. In Sahitya Academy Santali language was recognized and a separate section for Santali literature came into being. This also gave an impetus to Santali language and literature. Literature in ɔl ciki script started publishing in large numbers, Sahitya Academy started fellowships for the Santali writers. Though setting up of tribal schools was legislated during this period, not much headway was made in this respect. Therefore, Bengali medium schools and English medium schools were the main points of entry in schools, leading to regular contact with the Bengali students. From 2006 onwards Santali was recognized as a subject of study in colleges of the areas where Santali people concentrate in large numbers.
