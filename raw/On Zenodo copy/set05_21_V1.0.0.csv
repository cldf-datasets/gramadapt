Where possible, please also give an indication of when this contact through Social Exchange practices happened. ","Uruava, Torau and Mono speakers. Papapana ancestors were part of a migration from the south of Bougainville in the mid–19th century which settled first in the area around Kieta and Arawa (the once Uruava-speaking area), moved north up the eastern coast to the contemporary Papapana-speaking area, Teperoi, before moving south again, with a possible halt in Vito (contemporary Torau-speaking area), before settling in Teperoi in the late–19th century. Although Ross (1988) placed Papapana in the Nehan-North Bougainville subgroup of Northwest Solomonic (containing the languages of northern Bougainville and Buka), there are similarities in lexicon and syntax which raise the possibility that Papapana is related more closely to Uruava, and perhaps even Torau and Mono. This is further supported by i) similar Papuan-induced grammatical changes in these four languages (Evans and Palmer 2011, Smith 2016), ii) 3 of the 6 Papapana clan names are cognate with Uruavan clan names (Palmer 2007), iii) the name Papapana could come from Uruava pa-papa-na ‘uncles (mother’s brothers)’ (Palmer 2007).

Teop speakers. It seems that the history of the Papapana community is further complicated by intermarriage and further migrations from the north, including Teop speakers. This is supported by i) one of the Papapana clan names is cognate with a Teop clan name, ii) historical records by a missionary in the 1930s comment that the houses in Teperoi showed traces of two different tribes – from Buka&the north, and from Kieta (south), iii) a trader’s travelogue comments that the village’s reconstruction was reinforced by immigrants from north Bougainville and east Buka. 
Certainly in 2011-2013, there was intermarriage between Papapana speakers and Torau and Teop speakers (as well as other closely related languages like Halia and Tinputz).

There are similarities between Papapana and all the Northwest Solomonic languages above but it would be difficult to establish whether e.g. similar/identical lexemes result from genetic inheritance or contact.

Buin, Motuna/Siwai and Nasioi speakers. Speakers of these South Bougainville languages were recruited to work in the plantations surrounding Teperoi in the early 20th century. There are families in some of the Papapana villages like Maras and Kokoi, whose ancestors were Motuna or Buin speakers and who bought/were given Papapana land because they worked in the surrounding plantations. In 2011-2013 there were a number of intermarriages with Buin, Motuna/Siwai and Nasioi speakers, as well as Rotokas. This contact could have contributed, along with Rotokas, to the partial shift from left-headedness to right-headedness in Papapana (Smith 2016).

Where possible, please also give an indication of when this happened.","Uruava, Torau and Mono speakers. Papapana ancestors were part of a migration from the south of Bougainville in the mid–19th century which settled first in the area around Kieta and Arawa (the once Uruava-speaking area), moved north up the eastern coast to the contemporary Papapana-speaking area, Teperoi, before moving south again, with a possible halt in Vito (contemporary Torau-speaking area), before settling in Teperoi in the late–19th century. Although Ross (1988) placed Papapana in the Nehan-North Bougainville subgroup of Northwest Solomonic (containing the languages of northern Bougainville and Buka), there are similarities in lexicon and syntax which raise the possibility that Papapana is related more closely to Uruava, and perhaps even Torau and Mono. This is further supported by i) similar Papuan-induced grammatical changes in these four languages (Evans and Palmer 2011, Smith 2016), ii) 3 of the 6 Papapana clan names are cognate with Uruavan clan names (Palmer 2007), iii) the name Papapana could come from Uruava pa-papa-na ‘uncles (mother’s brothers)’ (Palmer 2007).

Teop speakers. It seems that the history of the Papapana community is further complicated by intermarriage and further migrations from the north, including Teop speakers. This is supported by i) one of the Papapana clan names is cognate with a Teop clan name, ii) historical records by a missionary in the 1930s comment that the houses in Teperoi showed traces of two different tribes – from Buka&the north, and from Kieta (south), iii) a trader’s travelogue comments that the village’s reconstruction was reinforced by immigrants from north Bougainville and east Buka. 

Certainly in 2011-2013, there was intermarriage between Papapana speakers and Torau and Teop speakers (as well as other closely related languages like Halia and Tinputz).

There are similarities between Papapana and all the Northwest Solomonic languages above but it would be difficult to establish whether e.g. similar/identical lexemes result from genetic inheritance or contact.

Buin, Motuna/Siwai and Nasioi speakers. Speakers of these South Bougainville languages were recruited to work in the plantations surrounding Teperoi in the early 20th century. There are families in some of the Papapana villages like Maras and Kokoi, whose ancestors were Motuna or Buin speakers and who bought/were given Papapana land because they worked in the surrounding plantations. In 2011-2013 there were a number of intermarriages with Buin, Motuna/Siwai and Nasioi speakers, as well as Rotokas. This contact could have contributed, along with Rotokas, to the partial shift from left-headedness to right-headedness in Papapana.

Papapana ancestors were part of a migration from the south of Bougainville in the mid–19th century which settled first in the area around Kieta and Arawa (the once Uruava-speaking area), moved north up the eastern coast to the contemporary Papapana-speaking area, Teperoi, before moving south again, with a possible halt in Vito (contemporary Torau-speaking area), before settling in Teperoi in the late–19th century. Although Ross (1988) placed Papapana in the Nehan-North Bougainville subgroup of Northwest Solomonic (containing the languages of northern Bougainville and Buka), there are similarities in lexicon and syntax which raise the possibility that Papapana is related more closely to Uruava, and perhaps even Torau and Mono. This is further supported by i) similar Papuan-induced grammatical changes in these four languages (Evans and Palmer 2011, Smith 2016), ii) 3 of the 6 Papapana clan names are cognate with Uruavan clan names (Palmer 2007), iii) the name Papapana could come from Uruava pa-papa-na ‘uncles (mother’s brothers)’ (Palmer 2007).

Teop speakers. It seems that the history of the Papapana community is further complicated by intermarriage and further migrations from the north, including Teop speakers. This is supported by i) one of the Papapana clan names is cognate with a Teop clan name, ii) historical records by a missionary in the 1930s comment that the houses in Teperoi showed traces of two different tribes – from Buka&the north, and from Kieta (south), iii) a trader’s travelogue comments that the village’s reconstruction was reinforced by immigrants from north Bougainville and east Buka. 

Certainly in 2011-2013, there was intermarriage between Papapana speakers and Torau and Teop speakers (as well as other closely related languages like Halia and Tinputz).

There are similarities between Papapana and all the Northwest Solomonic languages above but it would be difficult to establish whether e.g. similar/identical lexemes result from genetic inheritance or contact.

Buin, Motuna/Siwai and Nasioi speakers. Speakers of these South Bougainville languages were recruited to work in the plantations surrounding Teperoi in the early 20th century. There are families in some of the Papapana villages like Maras and Kokoi, whose ancestors were Motuna or Buin speakers and who bought/were given Papapana land because they worked in the surrounding plantations. In 2011-2013 there were a number of intermarriages with Buin, Motuna/Siwai and Nasioi speakers, as well as Rotokas. This contact could have contributed, along with Rotokas, to the partial shift from left-headedness to right-headedness in Papapana (Smith 2016).
