What is the time frame when the largest number of people had the most opportunities for interaction in the local community?,"Although the Tjwa were previously in contact with the Ndebele and Kalanga people, they never lived side by side with them as the former lived a nomadic way of life. 

When the British settlers arrived in the 1890s significant adjustments in Land Tenure and Administration happened between 1890 and 1896 (cf. Fleming 1974: 59). The British South Africa Company administrators of the future Rhodesia colony passed the Order in Council to create “native reserves”, with Gwaai and Shangani piloting the project. The colonial government continued to take land from the indigenous communities through various land and labour legislation. In 1898, the Department of Native Affairs was formed: it consisted of native commissioners whose duty was to control the indigenous people in everything they did. The native commissioners’ primary responsibility was to administer the Land Apportionment Act of 1931 and the Land Husbandry Act of 1951implementation. The Land Apportionment Act (cf. Land Apportionment Act, No. 30, 1930) divided the land into European and African reserves and forcibly removed the San people from the forest to which they were spiritually attached. The reserves assigned to the indigenous people were largely barren and marginal lands (cf. Wilson 1923: 88-89). According to Meredith (2002: 113), a decade after the arrival of the white colonists, approximately 16 million hectares had been taken by the colonial government from the indigenous people. 

The Tjwa people were part of the indigenous people who were relocated to the reserves far away from the forest, depriving them of their foraging grounds and subsistence strategies. Hunting wildlife became illegal over the next few years and the colonial administrators established rules which forbade snaring, mass-driving, and the digging of game pits. Incidentally, those were the methods most in use among the Tjwa people when hunting. For the colonial government, hunting was not a means of subsistence but a “fair chase” exercise, more of a personal taste and not so much a pursuit of food, certainly not a way of life (Haynes 2014: 110).

The resettlement of the Africans from areas designated as ‘game reserves’ was implemented across the nation. The colonial government argued that human beings and wildlife could not live together. Barriers such as fences were used to protect wildlife from the indigenous people. When Wankie was declared a game reserve in 1928, the Tjwa people were not immediately evicted to the reserves. The resettlement of the indigenous people was formalised in the Land Apportionment Act of 1930. The game reserve was later upgraded to the status of the national parks in 1949.",,Admire Phiri,DLC,1,Comment,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Phiri,Ndebele,Ndebele,nde,nort2795,Tjwao,Tjwao,tjwa1234,tjwa1234,Ndebele - Tjwao,nde-tjwa1234,nort2795-tjwa1234,Southern Africa,"FDG, EK"

The Ndebele people] led by their leader Mzilikazi, eventually found themselves reaching Zimbabwe in about 1837… On arrival, the Ndebele quickly conquered the Kalanga and Shona inhabitants living in the area around modern Bulawayo and established their own kingdom there turning some of the few indigenous people into Ndebele’s culture and language (Ngara, 1982: 19). 

2.The Matabele established themselves in their new environment by subjugating the original inhabitants in the territory between the Limpopo and Zambezi rivers. Their Impis foraged far and wide across the land, looting cattle and capturing women and children.

Most Tjwa people learned Tswana when they fled away to Botswana during the Gukurahundi massacres in 1983-1987.

When Mzilikazi arrived in the western parts of Zimbabwe he subdued and absorbed different people into his new state …. ‘Encouraged’ them to adopt the Ndebele language and culture at the expense of their own, they actually had no alternative to so doing as the Ndebele political and social systems were regarded as superior.… Thus, to survive within the Ndebele system, assimilated tribal groups had to seek refuge in the Ndebele language and culture.
