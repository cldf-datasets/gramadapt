The approximate proportion of native-like speakers in the total population of Garifuna speakers would rate in the intermediate range.  There is a segment of Garifunas who did not learn to speak it well, due to the push in schools (and in some homes) to favor Spanish or English (the dominant language, depending on the country) over Garifuna.  However, in recent years there has been a revival, and young people are genuinely interested in acquiring their ancestral language.   Nevertheless, it is difficult to estimate very accurately, since the United States Census does not share the exact numbers of Garifuna and Garifuna speakers with the general public.

Have there been any natural disasters or major societal upheaval during the densest period of contact between the [q2o1answer] speaking and [q2o2answer] speaking people, such it impacted people's mobility, and [q2o1answer] speaking people talk about it?",Yes,"There was at one point in history, around the mid-1600s one large group on St. Vincent island in the Caribbean (Lesser Antilles) that consisted of both the Garifunas and the Kalíponas (who spoke an Arawak language heavily inflected with Galibi (Carib) morphemes).  There are first-hand accounts of having viewed two distinct groups on the island, however, as they were known to fiercely protect their island from invaders, there are no in-depth studies on this relationship.  In later accounts beginning around 1700s, witnesses report having seen two distinct groups on either sides of St. Vincent; the native Indigenous on the leeward side of the island, and the Garifuna on the windward side.  It is possible that there may have been some contact between the Garifuna and the Kalipona during this time.  After two great wars (The First Carib War 1769-1773 and the Second Carib War 1795-1797) the Garifuna people were exiled from St. Vincent and contact with the Kalíponas would have ceased at this time.",Michelle A.
