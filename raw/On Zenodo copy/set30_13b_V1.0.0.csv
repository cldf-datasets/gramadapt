Sweden: 
18th to late 19th century (missionaries’ era) 
The Diet of 1723 established a school system for the Sami population. 
The Board of Ecclesiastical Affairs in the Laplands was instituted in 1739. The idea was to create a corps of native Sami ministers to secure proficiency in Sami language. 
Sami schools were residential schools, organized in each of 7 parishes. The State provided teaching, boarding, clothing, lodging at no expense. The primary language of instruction was the Saami language, the Sámi language (Kortekangas & al., 2019, p.15). 
There were 1894 students enrolled in 6 Sami Schools during 1732-1850 (Henrysson et al. 1993).

In 1740, the recruitment policy for ministers changed. The Sons of Swedish ministers were seen as perfect candidates as they were bilingual. This new policy created a corps of large bilingual clerical families that frequently intermarried.
The Sami school didn’t play a role in the education of these new candidates. 
This decision not to recruit ministers among Sami population coincided with the emergence of a new itinerant teacher category: the catechists (Kortekangas & al., 2019, p.20).
End of the 18th century, the policy “Lapp shall be Lapp” was introduced to protect Sami reindeer herders from modernization and promote their nomadic lifestyle. 
In the early 1900s: As a result, nomadic schools (Nomadskola) were established in 1913 (only for reindeer-herding Sami families). The idea was to prevent Sami children of reindeer herding families to assimilate into the Swedish society (Belancic, 2020). In the nomadic schools, the children spoke Sámi with each other, although teachers used Swedish as a language of instruction (Jannok Nutti, 2010; Svonni, 2007). Other Sami children attended regular Swedish schools to assimilate into mainstream society (Belancic, 2020).",Richard Kowalik & Sacha Beck,DKN,5,Types,At places which belong to the [q2o1answer],At places which belong to the [q2o2answer],At places which belong to some other group,This is highly contextual,NA,NA,NA,NA,Kowalik,South Saami,South Saami,sma,sout2674,NorwegianSwedish,NorwegianSwedish,nor,norw1258,South Saami - NorwegianSwedish,sma-nor,sout2674-norw1258,Eurasia,"OR, EK"

He highlights how Saami people had different interpretations of these symbols, showcasing the different attitudes towards Christianization and generally towards Norwegian-Swedish people. Lindmark gives the example of two young men. The first one, Olof, had a vision in 1671 and saw the Devil in the appearance of a minister, who asked him to burn the books. 

The second one, Anders, had fever for several days, and had a vision in which the Devil appeared in traditional Saami garb and claimed his soul. As this man tried escaping, he offered the Devil a book. The Devil answered Anders that “I can read more than you can”. The first one, Olof, resisted the missionary efforts and became a spokesperson for the Saami community, to defend their culture. Anders, on the other hand, became a virtuous Christian. Until the end of the 17th century, Saami people showed willingness to defend their culture, and disagreed with Christian’s traditions. Saami people defended their culture and religion successfully until the end of the 17th century (…) There are accounts of verbal defense from more than one place. In Lycksele, Olof Sjulsson (one of the rare literate persons) sent a letter to the King of Swen in 1687 to ask permission to use the drum as a means of orientation in the mountains (Lindmark, 2006, p.70). He was trying to find a way to secure Saami religious practice (Lindmark, 2014, p.58). Erich Esskillsson, after being confiscated a drum, said: “they should know that we will never abandon the ways of our forefathers” (Lindmark, 2014, p.58).

“the bilingual book (Swedish-Saami ABC from 1638) may have served as an educational medium for Saami people trying to learn Swedish (Forsgren 1988, p.12).

However, their linguistic abilities are described as poor in the 17th century especially (Lindmark, 2014). It can be deducted that they spoke Saami as well as their native tongue, the Norwegian-Swedish language. Sources show that Saami people learned some Norwegian-Swedish language. 

With the time, they became proficient. At the end of the 18th century, literature shows the emergence of a body of fully Saami-speaking ministers and teachers (no more bilingual books were printed) (Lindmark, 2014, p.60). In nomadic schools later (early 20th), Norwegian-Swedish language was the language of instruction. The children spoke Sámi with each other, although teachers used Swedish as a language of instruction (Jannok Nutti, 2010; Svonni, 2007).",Sacha Beck & Richard Kowalik,DKN,5,Types,The [q2o1answer] language,The [q2o2answer] language,Some other language,This is highly contextual,NA,NA,NA,NA,Kowalik,South Saami,South Saami,sma,sout2674,NorwegianSwedish,NorwegianSwedish,nor,norw1258,South Saami - NorwegianSwedish,sma-nor,sout2674-norw1258,Eurasia,"OR, EK"
