Williams (1936:187-206) extensively describes male initiation of Kerake (Nmbo) people, and the rituals appear to be tribally or village based. Membership to tribe and village are patrilineally traced, much like language. So Nen speakers are likely to have been involved in the knowledge domain with other Äkämär, who are ostensibly licensed Nen speakers. Unfortunately, neither of us know much about women's private circles. EK has heard about neighbouring Keraki women having gatherings where older women taught secret words of power to younger women, but does not know whether this included non-Keraki women. We understand of Idi speakers (Dibläg tribes people) is that they are considered culturally distinct from the Kerake/Äkämär/Nambu branch speakers, and so we are lead to believe that Dibläg have their own distinct set of esoteric and ritual knowledge. 

Church is a significant community space today, but again, these are organised on a village basis. Sometimes there are larger gatherings that span multiple villages, such as the women's fellowship held every few years - but this is something that only began with a specific missionary in the 1980s as far as we are aware. While this is a major event in the social calendar when it occurs, we feel it is yet to be established as a significant space of knowledge exchange across the Nen-Idi tribal divide.
