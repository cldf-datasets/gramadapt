List any comments or notes that you feel are relevant to this section of the questionnaire.,"Intermarriages between Sibe and Uighur people are rather rare due to the fact that the Uighurs are Moslems, while the Sibe are traditionally Buddhist ans shamanists. There is a general notion among the Sibe people that the customs of both groups differ to the extent of making cohabitation difficult. However, Uighur women are considered beautiful by Sibe men and a certain number of intermarriages has been occuring all the time. Due to the scarcity of such cases it is difficult to make generalizations in this respect. I have personally known only two Sibe men with Uighur wives, and heard about some five more. Intermarriages with non-Sibe have been more frequent in enclaves of Sibe outside the main area of their habitation. However, the first thing our consultants always mentioned when asked about intermarriages with Uighur was that Sibe would rather mainly marry Mongols and Kazakhs (in addition to Chinese)  than Uighurs.

Even though the main space of interaction between Uighur and Sibe children were Chinese language schools (the Sibe rarely attended Uighuir schools), much of the comunication among children was going on in minority languages. According to the information given by Sibe consultants, those who have good Uighur skills most often acquired them in these schools by speaking with their Uighur classmates. After 2000, Chinese has been taking ground as the main language of communication among children at schools. Additionally, between 1910 and 1945, part of the Sibe studied in a multilingual, Uighur-influenced environment, while others studied in a Sibe-monolingual ervironment.
