What are the [q2o1answer] speakers' attitudes towards linguistic transfers from [q2o2answer], such as lexical or grammatical borrowing?",Neither positive nor negative,"This writer is not qualified to discuss the influence of Manambu on Kwoma grammatically. The main borrowings of which he is aware are the many personal and other proper names Kwoma now use that derive from Manambu. This transfer of names is an old practice but increased after the 1920s when contact between the two language groups increased in intensity. One occasion when proper names were transferred historically (i.e. before about the 1920s) was during the settlement of long-standing feuds between different groups. This involved exchanging ritual, such as overmodelled skulls or carvings, along with their proper names and ‘ownership’ of the spirits they represented. One Kwoma name that derives from the Manambu is the village name ‘Bangwis’. This derives from the name of a ritual sub-division at Avatip and was given to the modern-day Bangwis village people in the late 1920s by a Manambu political leader. He gave them this name to enable them to distinguish themselves, in the eyes of the government, from eht people who adopted the name ‘Washkuk’, and are today located at Washkuk village, after they killed two native policemen visiting the settlement at which both factions were located in revenge for the rape of the wife of a ‘Washkuk’ man. These killings and their aftermath are described in J.K. McCarthy’s book Patrol Into Yesterday. Kwoma are unconcerned about the Manambu origin of many of their proper names, just as they are unconcerned about the fact that many of the personal names they use today are of Biblical or other Western origin.

No Kwoma woman would have agreed to marry into the Manambu language group since she lacked the canoeing skills of Manambu women. Likewise, Manambu women would never have agreed to marry Kwoma men since they intensely disliked, and were unskilled at, carrying heavy loads of produce in net bags slung from the backs of their heads along the steep and often slippery paths in the Washkuk Hills. Manambu women spend most of their days in tiny canoes that no Kwoma woman or man would ever step into.

Until very recently (e.g. 1980s) no marriages took place between Kwoma and Mamambu for ecological reasons.

Kwoma commonly fought alongside, and against, different Kaunga-speaking groups (Ndu family) to their east from the beginning of the 19th century until the 1950s, and communicated with them in both Kaunga and Kwoma; there has also been substantial intermarriage between the Kaunga and Kwoma during the same period, which continues today. Segments of both groups also reqularly participated in each other’s rituals, which required a high level of understanding of the host’s language, though whether this always required bilingualism is difficult to say. More than one Kwoma clan today is also descended from Kaunga-speaking immigrants.

2. Prior to 1950, Kwoma frequently fought against Apukili speakers to their north. This is now a defunct group which spoke a different language. This has not yet been identified but was probably Kwanga (the language spoken by a large population to the north of the Kwoma). Kwanga is the language most closely related to Kwoma. Kwoma also participated in Apukili rituals on a regular basis and many men spoke Apukili and vice versa. Some Kwoma clans trace their descent from the Apukili. Kwoma also say that many of their rituals are Apukili in origin.

3. Between the 1880s and 1920s the Kwoma occasionally fought against Iatmul speakers (Ndu family) now located at Brugnowi village, with whom they today have an active trading relationship. But contact with the Brugnowi has been relatively slight compared to that historically with the Kaunga (see above), the Manambu, and speakers of Mayo (Tama family) and Ngala (see below). In addition, there has never been intermarriage between Kwoma and Brugnowi.

4. From the earliest remembered time times (c1800) up to the 1950s Kwoma fought alongside Mayo speakers of the Maio dialect (Tama family), whose settlements today are located to the west in the Yesan (= Yessan) Hills at Maio and Yesan (= Yessan) villages.  During the last third of the 19th century the people now located at those two villages shared the Washkuk Hills with Kwoma, and interacted with them intensively. Some Kwoma clans also trace their origins to immigrants from Mayo-speaking villages. Speakers of the Nukuma dialect of Kwoma had a similarly close relationship with speakers of the Yau dialect of the Mayo language, to their west.

5. Between c1820 and c1860 Kwoma shared the Washkuk Hills with a Ndu-speaking people named Ngala. They interacted socially and probably intermarried, and many spoke the other’s language since they frequently participated in each other’s rituals. Eventually the two groups came into conflict and a combined of Kwoma and Maio dialect (Mayo language group) drove the Ngala out. The only Ngala speakers left today are at Swagup village further up the Sepik, a one-village language group.",NA,Ross Bowden,DLB,4,Comment,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Bowden,Kwoma,Kwoma,kmo,kwom1262,Manambu,Manambu,mle,mana1298,Kwoma-Manambu,kmo-mle,kwom1262-mana1298,North Coast New Guinea,"EK, OR"

From the beginning of the 19th century, when the two groups first encountered each other, Kwoma have traded with Kaunga speakers to the east. The Kaunga traded forest products such as the meat of game animals and black clay (used by Kwoma and Kaunga in painting) for stone from the Washkuk Hills. The latter is rare in the lowland swampy country the Kaunga occupy. Trade was between individual men, not between groups as in the case of women’s trade with the Manambu. Throughout the last two centuries up to the present, the relationship between Kwoma and Kaunga has been consistently more intense at all social levels than with the Manambu – ritually, militarily and in terms of inter-marriage.
