What are the [q2o1answer] speakers' general attitudes towards linguistic transfer, such as lexical or grammatical borrowing, from any other language than [q2o2answer]?",Neither positive nor negative,"This is ambivalent, as the ability to adapt and shift between languages is a central aspect of using language in Djibonker. Multilingualism is clearly the norm, and speakers are very comfortable to have multilingual conversations and actively pride themselves on their ability to do so. 
 (For an in-depth study of multilingual language use in Djibonker consult Weidl, M.M., 2021. The role of Wolof in multilingual conversations in the Casamance: Fluidity of linguistic repertoires. Köppe, R. - based on the phd thesis with the same title)
 When asked about the issue, many speakers of Baïnounk Gubëeher profess an overt aversion towards code-switching and mixing and state that too many loans make the language less pure, but in practice the same persons most certainly practice extensive code-switching and borrowing without any qualms only moments later (or even while badmouthing linguistic transfer). I suspect that these essentialist attitudes serve political purposes and are part of a certain set of ideologies that are part of the colonial and post-colonial perspective propagated in the media, government publications and the education system, but which have little to do with people's experiences of their linguistic (and cultural) surroundings and behaviours. The attitudes reflect what people think ought to be the case, but they happily engage in practices contrary to these assumptions that ar actually necessary for society to function.
 The integration of material from French is very common and not usually sanctioned. The switching between Baïnounk Gubëeher and Wolof, or the use of Wolof vocabulary is more frowned upon, as Wolof is considred by conservative speakers as a foreign and potentially hostile element, usually blamed for perceived language shift in young people and alleged loss of competence in Baïnounk Gubëeher. Contact with Joola languages accounts for the heaviest manifestations of contact induced language change, from phonology, to verbal morphology (person/number, TAM), noun class system and pragmatic structures. These phenomena are not generally registered as foreign, neither as polluting the language, only occasionally someone would remark that such and such item is 'actually' Joola, and make a show of replacing it with some more supposedly authentic Bainounk word. The numerous - probably centuries-old - lexical transfers from Portuguese-based Casamance Creole are also generally considered as authentically Bainounk.
 Obvious Mandinka transfers into Baïnounk Gubëeher would not be socially acceptable. and definitely judged as inappropriate. Speakers of other Bainounk lects or languages are often ridiculed for having incorporated Mandinka vocabulary and consequently their Bainounkness is put into doubt. This supposedly heavy Mandinguization is more often than not based on cliche̒s. I have heard people call varieties as Mandinguized, which they know almost nothing about, but whose speakers they consider as less Bainounk than them. In these cases any perceived difference in terms of language and culture from themselves was attributed to outside pollution and blamed on Mandinka, regardless of any linguistic or historical facts. Speakers with these attitudes also systematically ignore or downplay the transfers and contacts that have shaped their own language and culture (which is in turn highlighted by speakers of the other Bainounk varieties, who in turn consider themselves as bastions of linguistic and ethnic purity and all the others as mixed and diluted).",Alexander Cobbinah,OV,6,Scalar,Very positive,Positive,Neither positive nor negative,Negative,Very negative,NA,NA,NA,Cobbinah,Baïnounk Gubëeher,Bainounk Gubeeher,gube1234,gube1234,Mandinka,Mandinka,mnk,mand1436,Bainounk Gubeeher - Mandinka,gube1234-mnk,gube1234-mand1436,African Savannah,EK

What are the [q2o1answer] speakers' attitudes towards lectal differences within [q2o1answer]?,Neither positive nor negative,"There is very little regular variation within the language due to the small size of the community. On the other hand, the lack of a codified standard allows for quite some personal variation, with ensuing disputes about which form is 'correct' and whose Baïnounk Gubëeher is better or purer than someone else's (of course everyone insists it is certainly theirs). Speech styles of young people are sometimes dismissed as sloppy or degenerate by older or more conservative speakers, who question their linguistic skills and consider them as corrupted by modernity or urban styles. These styles involve lexical transfers, including conjunctions and frequent expressions, from French and Wolof. Generally, avoidance of obvious loans is considered as mark of proficiency, at least the ability to do so in situations when this is required (e.g. public speeches, religious discourses). 
 Perceived difference between Baïnounk Gubëeher and other Baïnounk languages is usualy dismissed as corruption through contact with other populations considered as foreign, assimilating or undesirable, usually Joola Fogny and Mandinka.",Alexander Cobbinah,OV,6,Scalar,Very positive,Positive,Neither positive nor negative,Negative,Very negative,NA,NA,NA,Cobbinah,Baïnounk Gubëeher,Bainounk Gubeeher,gube1234,gube1234,Mandinka,Mandinka,mnk,mand1436,Bainounk Gubeeher - Mandinka,gube1234-mnk,gube1234-mand1436,African Savannah,EK

Have there been any natural disasters or major societal upheaval during the densest period of contact between the [q2o1answer] speaking and [q2o2answer] speaking people, such it impacted people's mobility, and [q2o1answer] speaking people talk about it?",Yes,"The historical documentation suggests that the contact between established populations and Mandinka in the wake of the Madinka expansion between the 13th and 15th century was quite impacting and led to societal and economic restructuring. While the ruling elite in the Mande heartland in Mali converted to Islam already in the 4th century, Mande peasants and warriors who led the expansion continued to adhere to traditional forms of religion. The conversion of Mandinka (and assimilated local populations) established in Senegambia started only in the 17th century and was not accomplished until the 20th century (Toby Green 2011 & 2019). Religious tensions were exacerbated during the Mandinka Jihads that occurred in the Senegambia region at the end of the 19th century led by Fode̒ Kaba. The cultural and religious assimilation of autochtonous populations was thus not always peaceful, although the cultural and identitarian flexibility that characterises the populations of Casamance probably facilitated assimilation greatly, promising economic integration into powerful trade networks. Bainounk most probably never was a monolithic ethnic configuration, with each kin-based group enjoying considerable autonomy, some assimilating - and occupying positions of power withing the Mande world - and some resisting it vehemently. The elite of the powerful Kasanke state is usually described as Mandinguized Bainounk and until today the Bainounk speaking groups in Middle Casamance and Southern Gambia exist within a Mandinka societal framework and use Mandinka as lingua franca. Local tradition states that many nowadays ethnic Mandinka indeed have Bainounk ancestry. 
 Little detail is known about the linguistic and social history of the group that speaks what is now called Baïnounk Gubëeher, but local tradition does not relate a Mandinka domination or influence in the past. Independent of historic facts they present themselves as part of the groups that actively resisted cultural and economic assimlation into Mandinka statehood.
 I find the socio-historic models of Kopytoff and Scott helpful in interpreting the Mandinka- Bainounk contact. Scott's work deals mainly with South-East-Asian non-state population, but his characterization of state-avoiding population fit well with the social reality encountered nowadays in Western Lower Casamance (between Ziguinchor and the seabord): mobile kin-based groups with low hierarchies, high levels of multilingualism, flexible identities and oral cultures, who actively avoid statehood in defence of more autonomous modes of production. The subregion (of Western Lower Casamance), although deeply implicated in and affected by the Atlantic slave trade, has indeed successfully maintained distance to any state structures that have tried to assimilate the populations, be it the Mande states, the Portuguese and the French colonial state and the senegalese nation state through guerilla, armed resistance and since the 80s armed separatist movements. The fragmented geography of tidal marshlands and dense forests, hard to penetrate and impossible to control by outsiders has helped in this respect.
 For Scott, the so-called shatter zones at the fringes of usually rather predatory empires are intrinsically constituted as non-state areas, where refugee population who have escaped statehood concentrate and maintain their autonomous lifestyle avoiding forced labour and taxation. Kopytoff describes African societies as characterised by an administrated core and a fragmented, small-scale periphery. The seabord of Casamance is clearly a frontier society, that has maintained its egalitarian, non-state character (in terms of Scott's shatter zone). 
 The opposition and deep mistrust of Baïnounk Gubëeher and neighbouring Joola groups inhabiting Western Lower Casamance could plausibly be explained by these state vs. non-state dynamics. This would explain the fears of Mandinka colonization and assimilation and the avoidance of contact with populations identified as such and the stigma attached to other Bainounk populations perceived as linguistically and culturally assimilated. 
 This potential fault line between Baïnounk Gubëeher and Mandinka is further deepened by further economic and cultural differences. The perception of Mandinka as layz and unmanly expressed by Baïnounk Gubëeher speakers of Djibonker is clearly due to differing gender roles and gender-associated activities, as well as differences in subsistence. The Mandinka insistence on peanuts as main crop (alongside rice and other crops), is perceived as an unacceptable imposition, as interviewees have stated clearly. Rice is perceived as central to conceptions of identity and plays a central role in religious rites, where sheafs of rice and rice flour are used as offerings to the ancestors and other spirits. From a social organization point of view, in Baïnounk Gubëeher society agriculture is practiced by both men and women, with a strict division of labour: men do the muscle work to do with digging and field preparation, while women do bodily exhausting but less force-dependent work of planting and harvesting. The perception of Baïnounk Gubëeher informants is that Mandinka men do not engage at all in agriculture (this might be a cliche̒ though), and let women do all the work, which is considered completely unacceptable and contrary to their accepted gender roles by the Baïnounk Gubëeher. Typically male activities in Mandinka society would involve religious and political activities and trade - both of which are exercised by men and women in Baïnounk Gubëeher society.
 I believe that these differences in social organization have acted as a barrier to linguistic influence. The historical documentation suggests that the contact between established populations and Mandinka in the wake of the Madinka expansion between the 13th and 15th century was quite impacting and led to societal and economic restructuring.

Typically male activities in Mandinka society would involve religious services and trade - both of which are exercised by men and women in Baïnounk Gubëeher society.
 I believe that these differences in social organization have effectively functioned as a barrier to language contact between Mandinka and Baïnounk Gubëeher. The substantial grammatical and lexical differences between Baïnounk Gubëeher, heavily influenced by Joola languages on all levels of linguistic description, and Baïnounk Gujaher as spoken in Agnack Grand east of Ziguinchor, a language that is quite well integrated with the surrounding Mandinka populations, could thus be explained on this basis. Speakers of Gujaher from this community are by default multilingual in Mandinka and I suspect that apart from the obvious influences on the lexical level, the contact between Gujaher and Mandinka as part of speakers' multilingual repertoires has triggered profound changes in the noun class system, leading to a smaller number of noun classes (Mandinka is a non-noun class language) and the development and spread of a semantic, animacy based agreement system, as opposed to a purely morphosyntactic agreement system as witnessed in Baïnounk Gubëeher, which it shares with the adjacent Joola languages.

Has the local community ever been a relevant domain of contact between [q2o1answer] and [q2o2answer]?,No,"Mandinka are utterly and conspicuously absent in the loal sphere in Djibonker. In ten years of field stays there, amounting to more than two years of time altogether I have never met a Mandinka person, or heard the Mandinka language anywhere in the village. Considering that many of the spouses, escpecially the wives come from outside the village, and considering that Mandinka speaking areas are situated relatively close to Djibonker, this asks for an explanation. 
In the Myfyr Prys questionnaire, 12 of 14 participants replied to the question: ""Languages spoken by the worst friend for sons or daughters"" with 'Mandinka'. 11 of 14 replied to the question after 'worst spouse' with 'Mandinka'. None stated 'Mandinka' when asked after best spouse or best friend for son or daughter. The stigma attached to Mandinka seems to actively inhibit friendships and marriages. Apart from being generally considered as lazy, Mandinka also are frequently described as crooked and untrustworthy, to te extent that they are activley excluded from the local space. 
One of our project members brought a Mandinka-speaking spouse to an adjacent village and he was met by mistrust and hostility.  Religion does not seem to be the problem, as villagers marry and interact with Muslims, and often have Muslims in their families.

Have [q2o1answer] and [q2o2answer] people occupied the same spaces of knowledge transfer together?,No,"Knowledge transfer in the religious and cultural spheres provides few regular opportunities of contact between Baïnounk Gubëeher and Mandinka in the current setting. I cannot make assumptions about the past, although due to the spacial proximity some form of knowlege exchange most probably has taken place at some point. 
 The people of Djibonker are deeply integrated into Joola-speaking networks (Joola Kaasa, Joola Fogny, Joola Kujireray, Bayot) and marginally into Creole speaking networks. The overwelming majority is either Catholic, of local religion or both, whereas most speakers of Mandinka, or who identify as such are Muslim. The prohibition of alcohol in Islam is seen as a major obstacle to participation in cultural events by many Baïnounk Gubëeher and surrounding Joola, due to the fact that many rites involve the consumption of palmwine. Probably more detrimental to Baïnounk Gubëeher/Mandinka cultural integration is the widespread assumption that Mandinka language and culture dominates those who they 'colonize', leading to rapid language shift, name change and islamization. Often interviewees have accused other Baïnounk groups of being inauthentic due to Mandinka influence, and speaking 'impure' varieties of Baïnounk languages. This is of course anecdotal - citing emblematic but isolated items of vocabulary - and does not reflect real outcomes of language contact. More than anything it illustrates the perceived polluting capacity of Mandinka language and culture in the eyes of speakers of Baïnounk Gubëeher. It is ignored that Baïnounk Gubëeher also uses Mandinka loans and shows a heavy influence of local Joola varieties, which in turn is not considered as polluting or diluting real 'Bainounkness'.
 One participant as much as urged me to not quote Mandinka as one of the languages she speaks, because as she said, she has learned the language in her youth cohabiting with Mandinka, and understands it, but will never speak it again, because she wants nothing to do with Mandinka and hates everything to do with them. She also reported the common stereotype that Mandinka refuse to speak other languages and force everyone else to speak Mandinka, an act of utter rudeness in the eyes of the highly multilingual and adaptive Baïnounk Gubëeher.
 When asked about what language the 'worst teacher' would speak, only one person in 14 did not say 'Mandinka', which reflects the unwillingness to enter into situations of knowledge exchange with anyone perceived as Mandinka.
 Somehow Mandinka have taken the role of social and cultural nemesis, laden with negative stereotype and actively excluded from the social and cultural sphere, due to fears of cultural takeover and pollution as well as deviant behaviour in terms of work ethics.",Alexander Cobbinah,DKN,4,Binary-YesNo,Yes,No,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Cobbinah,Baïnounk Gubëeher,Bainounk Gubeeher,gube1234,gube1234,Mandinka,Mandinka,mnk,mand1436,Bainounk Gubeeher - Mandinka,gube1234-mnk,gube1234-mand1436,African Savannah,EK
