However, there is no extra-linguistic data on a possible migration of the Zazakî speakers. Whether and when they migrated from where or not is very hypothetical, which a) is based on morphosyntactic correlations between Zazakî and some languages of the Caspian Sea and b) erroneously goes back to the fact that the tribal names Dimilî and Daylam are the same (a basically refuted fallacy, which dates from the beginning of the 20th century).
