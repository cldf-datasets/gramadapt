If we ask the Alorese people today, they would answer that the Alorese and the Adang are equal, although the answer might have been different in the past. The Adang are the older community so in a certain way they probably were considered superior in the past, as witnessed by the fact that the Alorese king’s clan Bungabali has Adang origin. Until the Dutch takeover of Alor in 1851, the Adang were the rulers. After the Dutch takeover, the ruler of the Adang village O’a, ceded power to the Alorese Bungabali lineage of Alor Besar village.
