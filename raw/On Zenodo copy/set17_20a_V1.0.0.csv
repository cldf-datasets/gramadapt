According to Carrasco (1950), Otomi, Matlatzinca, Mazahua, and Nahuatl were spoken in Toluca during the 16th century, before the arrival of the Spanish. Well, Toluca was the main Matlatzinca center (Lastra 2010: 26).With respect to Nahuatl, the contact between the Otomi and the Nahuatl began in the 10th century. At the beginning of contact, Nahuatl must have been influenced by Otomi since it was the dominant culture. However, as they were subdued by the Aztecs, the roles were reversed and from the 13th century, Nahuatl became the dominant language until the Spanish arrived in the 15th century. (Hekking y Bakker 2010: 31).
