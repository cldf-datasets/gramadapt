How long have [q2o1answer] and [q2o2answer] people been in contact overall?,Up to a 1000 years,"Probably since the Aymara reached the Bolivian high plateau, i.e. (roughly) around 1100 or 1200 AD Interaction probably increased during (early) colonial times when the Chipaya were forced to settle down in one village (a so-called reduction; this is actually the way the still existing village of Santa Ana de Chipaya was founded) and encouraged (or forced) to assimilate to the Aymara lifestyle. The Chipaya constitute a small and rather secluded community in the western Bolivian highlands. The number of inhabitants of the only Chipaya village - Santa Ana de Chipaya - amounts to 1,000 to 2,000 people. The Chipaya language is acquired and spoken only in this one village, which otherwise is surrounded by an Aymara-speaking population. 
The overall relationship between Chipaya and Aymara people can be described as rather negative to hostile: the Aymara despise the Chipaya people for their largely non-pastoralist, non-agriculturalist lifestyle, while the Chipaya claim that the Aymara stole their land.

The Aymara are probably the indigenous group that exercises the greatest political power in highland Bolivia (and possibly beyond) and jurisdictional organisation is complex as traditional and western ideas and concepts are mixed. There is no political party that I know of which is explicitly dedicated to the Aymara people and while there is a term 'nación Aymara' (the Aymara nation), it does not bear the idea of an independent Aymara state. The Aymara form part of the multi-ethnic state of Bolivia and officially are just one group among several others. However, between 2006 and 2019, Evo Morales of the MAS party (MAS = movimiento al socialismo, 'Movement towards Socialism') held the presidency of Bolivia. As he is an Aymara, during his government the Aymara people experienced a very active representation of their interests by Morales himself (something he has been repeatedly criticised for) and in a sense, Bolivia was ruled according to Aymara ideas and ideals during that time. So at least the highland part of Bolivia could be described as a de facto Aymara state during Morales' government.

However, according to my reckoning, these seasonal workers do not contribute to Chipaya-Aymara language contact to a relevant degree, either. First, most (if not all) of these seasonal workers return to their village once their work on the plantation is done; and, second, the language used on the Chilean and Argentinian plantations is Spanish rather than Aymara (which is not used in Chile or Argentina).

How long have [q2o1answer] and [q2o2answer] people been in contact in the local community?,Up to a 1000 years,"There are many conflicting views on the prehistoric distribution and spread of Central Andean languages, including Aymaran. Nevertheless, according to a majority view, the Aymaran language family is, for a number of reasons, thought to originate somewhere on the coast or adjacent highlands of Central Peru, significantly farther to the north of the site of Chipaya-Aymara contact in the Bolivian altiplano. From there, what would become the Aymara language proper would expand further south, and reach the altiplano of Bolivia in the Late Intermediate Period of the cultural chronology of the central Andes that began around 1000 AD (1000 years BP). This date thus forms the terminus post quem for the onset contact with Uru and Chipaya, which is usually tacitly assumed to have been established in situ at the point of Aymara expansion. A recent alternative view shifts the consolidation of Aymara on the altiplano back in time by several hundred years, up to the times of the Inca empire in the 14th and 15th centuries AD.

However, we consider it likely that the current prestige asymmetry between Aymara and Chipaya (from the point of view of Aymara speakers, at least) can be extrapolated to the prehistoric situation, as the Aymara expansion was likely driven by powerful socioeconomic dynamics and has, in the form of loanwords, even reached lowland languages. The contemporary situation thus likely represents to some extent a continuation of contact in the past. However, given that it might have time after first contact for the Aymara contact to penetrate into language use inside the local community, and that an alternative emerging view postdates the arrival of Aymara in the region by several hundred years, we believe that the greatest opportunities are to be sought some time after the Aymara expansion, plausibly in historic times and even in the very recent past, which we will use in the following as the basis for filling the questionnaire.",Katja Hannß & Matthias Urban,DLC,1,Comment,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Hanss1Urban2,Chipaya,Chipaya,cap,chip1262,Central (aka Bolivian) Aymara,Central Aymara,ayr,cent2142,Chipaya - Central Aymara,cap-ayr,chip1262-cent2142,Andean,"FDG, OR"

The village is surrounded by Aymara-speaking settlements. However, the Chipaya language is not used by outsiders because the Chipaya were socially looked down upon by their Aymara (and Quechua) neighbours who are agriculturalists and pastoralists, while the Chipaya traditionally pursue an acquatic-based lifestyle of hunting, fishing and gathering. 
As outside activities, such as trade, are traditionally pursued by men, most of them are/were bilingual in Chipaya and Aymara, while women are responsible for domestic tasks and usually show a lower level of Chipaya-Aymara bilingualism. The generation of men that today is (roughly) between 50 and 70 years old is often trilingual in Chipaya, their native language, Aymara, the traditional contact language, and Spanish in which they were formally educated. Women of the same age cohort are often not trilingual and may not have command of Aymara and/or Spanish. The middle-aged and younger generations (40 years and less of age) usually do not acquire Aymara any longer although they may have some passive knowledge of it.

1.0.0,set16,set23,D10,DLC29,,9. Do [q2o1answer] people experience the local community differently depending on social group?,No,"On the overall, I would say 'no' to this question but would like to modify it a bit. Traditionally, women (all over the rural Andean Altiplano, not just in Chipaya) are responsible for taking care of the house and the children. Thus, Chipaya women do not travel to La Paz as frequently as the Chipaya men but Chipaya women certainly are allowed to visit La Paz and other places with a predominantly Aymara population and do so. When visiting those Aymara-dominated places, Chipaya women interact with non-Chipaya men and thus, there is no gender-related code of conduct that would prohibit Chipaya women to interact with male outsiders (and vice versa). Also, Aymara women marry into the Chipaya community but there are also Chipaya women marrying Aymara men (thereby usually leaving the Chipaya community). My impression is that the latter is less frequent than the first scenario and Chipaya women leaving their community to live with their Aymara husbands are apparently violating the rule that the (eldest) daughter has to support her parents, and especially her mother, with all domestic tasks. However, these cases (i.e. a Chipaya woman marrying or living together with an Aymara man) are still attested. 

When it comes to class, the Aymara population of the villages surrounding the Chipaya community hardly differ from the Chipaya themselves with respect to their economic status, so there is no notable economic or class-related difference between the Chipaya people and their equally rural Aymara neighbours. That is, when the Chipaya socialise with the Aymara population from the neighbouring villages, no differences in class are observable as virtually everybody belongs to the same class (roughly speaking, peasants). Hence, the answer to the question would rather be 'no' again. It is only when Chipaya people visit places with a larger population and hence a more stratified society that class starts playing a role, as is the case in La Paz, for instance. In this case, Chipaya people do tend to interact with the lower-class Aymara people rather than with middle- or upper-class Aymara people. However, the same observation holds for the rural Aymara population who likewise interacts with the lower-class Aymara population rather than with middle- or upper-class Aymara people. That is, it is the economic status that determines the kinds and types of social interaction more than ethnicity.",Katja Hannß & Matthias Urban,DLC,1,Binary-YesNo,Yes,No,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Hanss1Urban2,Chipaya,Chipaya,cap,chip1262,Central (aka Bolivian) Aymara,Central Aymara,ayr,cent2142,Chipaya - Central Aymara,cap-ayr,chip1262-cent2142,Andean,"FDG, OR"

How long have [q2o1answer] and [q2o2answer] people traded for?,Possibly from 600 AD onward,"This is, for a number of reasons, a difficult question for the Central Andes. For one, there are certain theories that deny that institutions like markets even existed in the ancient Central Andes with commodities exchanged within communities/societies rather than ""traded"". Long-distance trade relations usually were important mostly to get exotic valuables for local elites. But even if we accept that the notion of ""trade"" is relevant for prehistory, the answer strongly depends on whose point of view one adopts. Alfredo Torero has maintained that Aymara served as a trade language during the Middle Horizon, when the Wari and Tiwanaku cultures flourished (the latter being altiplano-based), though the implied  association of Aymara is more with Wari than with Tiwanaku. This is not a commonly accepted theory however. If there is some truth to it, then we could say that commercial interactions involving Aymara speech might have started as early as 600 AD already. At least this would give a broad terminus post quem for such contacts. Commercial interactions might have started only significantly later, after the arrival of Aymara on the altiplano and only 1000 AD reached signficant intensities still later",Katja Hannß,DTR,4,Comment,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Hanss1Urban2,Chipaya,Chipaya,cap,chip1262,Central (aka Bolivian) Aymara,Central Aymara,ayr,cent2142,Chipaya - Central Aymara,cap-ayr,chip1262-cent2142,Andean,"FDG, OR"

Usually, a lorry comes once in a month from the departmental capital of Oruro and brings these and other goods. However, when the River Lauca that separates Chipaya from Oruro and other Aymara settlements is flooded the lorry cannot cross the river and the Chipaya community does not receive these products.

Does involvement in trade differ based on hierarchies associated to profession or wealth, such as a person's class or caste?",No,"One difference concerns sex. It is usually the men doing the trading as most trade occurs outside the village of Santa Ana de Chipaya and most outwards activities are accomplished by men. That is, in order to participate in any trading activity, the Chipaya people have to leave their village and go to one to of the larger cities. Travelling 'abroad', however, is rather associated with males. However, Chipaya women are by no means forbid to travel to the places where trade takes place and thus can and do travel to e.g. Oruro or La Paz to purchase goods. This is more of an interesting observation on the side: within the Aymara community, trade is firmly in the hands of women. That is, practically all stands on a market are run by Aymara women. If a stand is run by a man, it is clear that he has no female relative who could run the stand for him.
The second difference concerns literacy. Illiteracy is still relatively common even among the middle Chipaya generation. Thus, for large-scale trading activities, like selling cattle, the Chipaya community may choose a man (here, sex plays a role again) who is literate so they may not get cheated in selling their surplus cattle.

Chipaya women are less frequently involved in trade-related travelling (although they are perfectly entitled to travel). Depending on the nature of the goods purchased, Chipaya men may primarily interact with Aymara women when visiting the local markets in e.g. Oruro or La Paz because running a market stand is a typical female task within the Aymara community. These stands offer a wide variety of products, from food stuff to clothing and household appliances. However, contact, of course, also involves contact with Aymara men, e.g. when the Chipaya want to purchase items typically associated with men and thus traded by these, such as technical equipment.  
Social class is also factor that comes in but is not specific of the Chipaya people. That is, a lower-class Aymara person has probably as much possibility to get into contact with a middle-or upper-class Aymara person as a Chipaya person.

Where possible, please also give an indication of when this happened.","This question can only be answered tentatively, for theoretical and practical reasons. For one, the entire notion of ""trade"" for the prehistoric Andes is not uncontroversial, with some scholars arguing for instance that markets were absent before European colonization.

For Chipaya, we consider possible that commercial interactions may have happened with people from two different regions, even though what we can see is only the faintest evidence that is *suggestive* of such contacts, but does not prove it.

First, speakers of highland languages: Puquina, and later also Quechua. Puquina was an autochthonous language of the altiplano, and many linguists like to associate it with the powerful Tiwanaku territory that underheld extensive trading networks (caravan-based) in all directions from their capital on the shores of Lake Titicaca. This would have happened in a timeframe of approx. 600-1000 AD, and possibly continued after the demise of Tiwanaku. Later, as Quechua became established in the altiplano, possibly due to Inca expansion, interaction with speakers of Quechua is also a real possibility.

However, there is also some suggestive evidence for linguistic contact with languages of the Yungas that may have had a ""commercial"" background, such as Leco and Mosetén, which share with Chipaya the word for a culturally very important crop and stable: maize.",NA,Katja Hannß,DTR,4,Comment,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Hanss1Urban2,Chipaya,Chipaya,cap,chip1262,Central (aka Bolivian) Aymara,Central Aymara,ayr,cent2142,Chipaya - Central Aymara,cap-ayr,chip1262-cent2142,Andean,"FDG, OR"

I have focused on Chipaya in this section as this is the group that is mostly involved in trading. However, and as outlined here and elsewhere, Chipaya women do participate in trading activities as well, only less frequently than men. This section focuses on trading with the Aymara people which means that the Chipaya have to leave their village and this is traditionally and typically the men's task. However, small-scale trading within the Chipaya village, e.g. selling on products delivered by the monthly lorry, is done by women. Often, they have little shops, sometimes mere windows from their houses, where they sell on products brought from Oruro. This behaviour is in line with what can be observed in the rest of the (Central and Southern) Andes: trading is usually done by women.",NA,Katja Hannß,DTR,4,Comment,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Hanss1Urban2,Chipaya,Chipaya,cap,chip1262,Central (aka Bolivian) Aymara,Central Aymara,ayr,cent2142,Chipaya - Central Aymara,cap-ayr,chip1262-cent2142,Andean,"FDG, OR"
