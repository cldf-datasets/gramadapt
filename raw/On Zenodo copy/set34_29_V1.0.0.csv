How long have [q2o1answer] and [q2o2answer] people been in contact overall?,"According to historical sources, both Wutun and Bonan communities emerged during the Chinese Yuan Dynasty (1279-1368) when China was ruled by the Mongols. At that time, the Upper Yellow River Plateau (the eastern part of Modern Qinghai Province and southern part of Modern Gansu Province) formed a border area between Chinese and Tibetan Empires. The expansion of Mongol rule caused migration of Mongolic and Sinitic speakers to the region. In the Tongren area of Qinghai Province where Wutun and Bonan are spoken, the local Mongolic and Sinitic speakers, the ancestors of Bonan and Wutun communities, were organized into hereditary border guard units whose work was to patrol the borders of Chinese Empire. It is likely that Wutun and Bonan speakers worked together that time. The modern ethnonym Wutun, 'five garrisons' refers to the origin of Wutun  villages as military garrisons.",[Response text is a copy from comment in response DLB01],Erika Sandman,OV,6,Comment,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Sandman,Wutun,Wutun,wuh,wutu1241,Bonan,Bonan,peh,bona1250,Wutun - Bonan,wuh-peh,wutu1241-bona1250,Inner Asia,EK
