1.0.0,set29,set10,P1,DEM00,,1. Has exchange ever been a relevant domain of contact between [q2o1answer] and [q2o2answer]?,Yes,"Both social exchange and marriage are relevant to contact between various subgroups of the Burarra and Yolngu Matha language groups. These connections were likely more codified in pre-colonial and early colonial times, but certainly continue in the present time. Both ceremony and gift-exchange are salient domains. I provide specific examples below.
EXCHANGE BETWEEN SPECIFIC GROUPS
Distinct patterns of exchange and marriage exist between different clan and dialect groups within the Burarra and Yolngu Matha groups. Extensive ceremonial, cultural and economic links existed and still exist to a degree between the Yan-nhangu (a Yolngu group of the Crocodile Islands) and north-eastern Burarra people who own territory around Cape Stewart (e.g. Bowern and James 2006). The two groups interact closely and regularly, characterising themselves as ‘close’ (yi-gurrepa in Burarra; galki in Yan-nhangu) (Bagshaw 1998: 249). The two groups share major religious resources and can be subsumed under a variety of (in some cases moiety-specific) designations which each pick out some salient aspect of the shared territory (e.g. Maringa (‘coast’); Gulala (‘mangrove pod’)).
At the southern reaches of Burarra territory, speakers of the Gun-nartpa dialect of Burarra also connect closely with Yolngu groups. They are more closely affiliated with inland freshwater country kin from the Yolngu Djinang/Wurlaki-speaking clans (as well as Rembarrnga/Kune, Kuninjku and Gurr-goni – speaking clans) than with their coastal Burarra neighbours. They connect also with Yolngu groups from the further-afield Yurrwi/Milingimbi area on the Crocodile Islands (including Yan-nhangu speaking groups). There is a local theory of language origins that states that the Gun-nartpa, along with other Burarra speakers, originated at Yurrwi, but following tribal war the ancestors of the Gun-nartpa moved inland. A contemporary example of the connection between these groups is the presence of large jambang ‘tamarind’ trees that grow at Gochan Jiny-jirra, a Gun-nartpa outstation of the An-nguliny clan. These were grown from seeds collected from Yurrwi by a young Gun-nartpa man who was encouraged to take them from a Macassan trepang site by the local landowners. As Carew notes, “the presence of the trees is an instantiation of the kinship and ceremonial connections between their group and Yirrichinga clan groups at Milingimbi, who do own Macassan sites” (Carew 2016: 72).
At various points along the Burarra/Yolngu boundary, speakers from both groups have been in close long-term contact within particular clan ‘aggregates’ or ‘clusters’ – higher level groupings of clans which were/are affiliated, which would have spent much time together (perhaps seasonally) and which may share Dreamings, sites and territory. Examples: the Manydjikay clan aggregate includes Burarra and Yan-nhangu (Keen 1978: 24; see also Bagshaw 1998: 271), and the Marrangu clan aggregate or ceremonial polity includes (Jowunga/Dhuwa moiety) Djinang and Martay Burarra clans (Elliot 1991, 2015; Carew 2016).

THE NATURE OF BURARRA/YOLNGU CEREMONIAL EXCHANGE 
– ceremony
Exchange between Burarra and Yolngu groups occurs often through diplomacy rituals, funeral performances and initiation ceremonies. The reciprocity observable in ceremonial participation and exchange is central to structuring social life in Arnhem Land (Carew 2016: 102, Brown 2014). Examples of ceremonies conducted for inter-group diplomacy which implicate these two groups include Rom (involving the presentation of a decorated pole as a gift e.g. Altman 2008, Wild 1986) and Marrajiri (pre-colonially a post-burial ceremony but now a birth celebration, e.g. Borsboom 1978). Historically, these ceremonies would have provided opportunities for exchanging goods, but now goods are acquired through the market. Nevertheless, ceremonies like these continue to provide opportunities for social exchange and serve as markers of distinct group identity (Altman 2008: 15).
– funerals and initiation
Funerals, especially for clan leaders, and japi (young men’s initiation), and associated bunggul (dance performance) and manakay (song performance), are other rituals attracting participants from across a large region (e.g. Brown 2014) and regularly across Burarra/Yolngu Matha groups. Typically particular kin relations will have special roles in these ceremonies, necessitating cooperation and exchange between culturally connected groups, such as the Burarra and Yolngu. Mortuary rituals also function as sites of ceremonial exchange, such as the lorrkon ceremony performed by both Yolngu (e.g. Djinang) and Burarra groups (e.g. Keen 1978: 157) in which the bones of dead person are prepared for final internment in a carved and painted hollow log. The film ‘Waiting for Harry’ (McKenzie 1980) documents the recovery of the remains of Frank Gurrmanamana's brother (who had been buried in Maningrida six years earlier) to Jina-wunya – a Burarra outstation – for Frank for arrange the final mortuary ceremony. The ceremony crucially involved the participation of Yan-nhangu men from Cape Stewart whose mothers’ mothers came from the deceased’s clan (see also Clunies-Ross 1989). At this and other similar funeral/mortuary gatherings involving Burarra and Yolngu groups, there is evidence from several accounts that Burarra has been used as a lingua franca between the coastal groups (Carew 2016: 79). E.g. Clunies-Ross (1983) describes a Yan-nhangu man giving an oration in Burarra at an An-barra Burarra funeral, his language being “somewhat accented but not ... ungrammatical” (Clunies-Ross 1983:10) (although Carew (2016: 79) suggests that this may in fact just be the Maringa dialect of Burarra).

– gift exchange

Gift exchange between the Burarra and Yolngu has occurred as a ritualised part of ceremonial exchange, and also in some other non-ritualised contexts. As part of the modern Marajiri/Maradjiri ceremony, for example, a ‘birth pole’ is prepared and gifted ""to make friends"" with another group, ""[to] stress the indissoluble unity between a group of people, natural species and a certain locality"" (Borsboom 1978: xiv and 15, cited in Elliot 1991). The gifting described above of tamarind seeds to a young Gun-nartpa man from landowners at Yurrwi provides an example of non-ceremonial gifting (Carew 2016: 72).

N.B.: REGARDING DESCRIBING CONTACT BETWEEN THESE GROUPS
1) A complicating factor in discussing contact between language groups in northern Australia is that language does not always delineate the most salient and important social boundaries between groups. That is to say, examples are readily observable where a single social and political group (such as a clan) is affiliated with more than one language (e.g. the Gamal and Bindararr clans which are affiliated with both Burarra and the Yolngu variety Yan-nhangu). Conversely, there are groups which are socially, culturally and geographically distinct but which ostensibly share the same language (e.g. the ‘freshwater’ Gun-nartpa people and the coastal Burarra, both of whom speak Burarra). As anthropologist Ad Borsboom notes of Djinang-speaking groups: “[s]hared language does not make a unity of these clans” (Borsboom 1978:23, see also Keen 1978; Carew 2016). Instead, the clan is typically the most prominent social unit, with language one of many secondary indices for identity in the region. ‘Burarra’ and ‘Yolngu Matha’, then, refer to loose affiliations of interconnected social groups, but are cross-cut by various other intergroup boundaries – social, ceremonial, cultural, economic, geographical etc. It’s therefore the case that I am able to generalise across these loose groups on some points but on others I will need to be more specific, say at the clan/clan aggregate/dialect or someother level (where information exists).
2) When considering contact between these two groups, it’s important to centralise the long-standing high levels of multilingualism in the region. Although an individual will typically identify with a single language through her/his patrilineal line, local language repertoires usually take in several languages. So many Burarra people would have spoken Yolngu languages pre-colonially and still do, and vice versa. So yes there is ‘contact’ between somewhat distinct social groups which can be identified as Burarra or Yolngu, but linguistic contact is not restricted to these encounters as many speakers involved would already speak both languages since childhood (e.g. through mother or grandparents, see marriage discussion below). For example, Gun-nartpa people today typically speak the Yolngu language Djinang and Kune as well their own variety of Burarra (Carew 2016: 67).",Jill Vaughan,DEM,1,Binary-YesNo,Yes,No,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Vaughan,Burarra,Burarra,bvr,bura1267,Yolngu Matha,Yolngu Matha,yuul1286,yuul1239,Burara - Yolngu Matha,bvr-yuul1286,bura1267-yuul1239,North Australia,EK

E.g. Elwell (1977: 24-26) groups the Burarra with various Yolngu groups (Djinang, Yan-ngangu, Gupapuyngu, Gumatj and Wangurri) under the 'Eastern Arnhem Land tribes' umbrella, noting their shared patrilineal social structure (also Armstrong 1967: 14-15).

Within a ceremonial context (as described above in discussion on influence), the relationship could be characterised as complementary and fairly egalitarian. And as is typical of small-scale multilingual contexts, the languages are understood to be egalitarian, with each having its own special rights associated with a particular tract of land. Having said this, in Clunies-Ross' (1989: 120) discussion of the participation of Yan-nhangu (YM) men in a Burarra mortuary ritual says the following: ""It is clear from this speech [i.e. a speech from one of the Yan-nhangu men] and many others like it on the Waiting for Harry footage that the spirit of cooperation and helpfulness between aburramari [i.e. men whose mother's mothers came from the deceased's clan] and the owning clans points to an only thinly veiled underlying rivalry.

Strong language ideologies exist dictating use of the patrilect by both groups across all settings, and this does play out in many contexts, including certain more 'performative' and broadcast communication, and in the practice of receptive multilingualism whereby e.g. married couples will each use their own language in conversation. 

However situations also arise where Burarra and YM speakers would use an L2, and for these speakers that would often be Burarra and YM. E.g. during ceremonial exchange ppl may use the language of their hosts. Clunies-Ross (1983: 10) notes that Burarra is used in an funeral oration by a Yan-nhangu man, and Elwell (1977: 25-6) also notes Gupapuyngu (YM) as a regional lingua franca among the 'eastern bloc'.

Code-switching does occur but is less prevalent than might be predicted from the typological congruence on the languages (Vaughan 2021) – i.e. Burarra and YM linguistically ‘congruent’ but not socially congruent (following Sebba 1998). Examples of intersentential code-switching are however fairly common, and intrasentential code-switching does happen sometimes, for example between Burarra and Yan-nhangu formerly as an expression of a hybrid ‘Yan-nhangu-Burarra’ identity which, in contemporary times, is now largely expressed through the Burarra language (as very few speakers now have fluent command of Yan-nhangu).",Jill Vaughan,DEM,1,Types,The [q2o1answer] language,The [q2o2answer] language,Some other language,This is highly contextual,NA,NA,NA,NA,Vaughan,Burarra,Burarra,bvr,bura1267,Yolngu Matha,Yolngu Matha,yuul1316,yuul1239,Burara - Yolngu Matha,bvr-yuul1316,bura1267-yuul1239,North Australia,EK

This also means outside the clan group, since clans are patrilineal and therefore made up of people from the same moiety. Both groups have ideologies about which kin category is an ideal marriage. For Yolngu – “the ideal wife for a man is a woman classified as 'mother's brother's daughter', called galay (Warner 1969:43). An actual MBD is best, but if no-one of that near relationship is available, then one as near by blood as possible is preferred (1969:46); ""men marry a woman of their mother's clan who is their galay, and/or the daughter of a mukul rumaru of their mother's mother's clan or a classificatory mother's mother's clan"" (Keen 1978:110). For Burarra – “a man has rights in certain women as potential mothers-in-law. These are women to whom the man applies the kin term djabur, who are members of his mother's generation or alternate generations, and who are members of his mother's mother's patrilineal group, or whose own mother's mothers belong(ed) to the man's patrilineal group. Among a man's genealogically closest djabur, his MMBD, MMBSSD, FZDD and DDD are his potential mothers-in-law” (Keen 1982). These are all kin categories of the opposite moiety, and often result in close connections between clans linked by regular marriage links. As Keen (1982) summarises: “The Gidjingali [Burarra] community consists of a number of small patrilineal land-owning units linked together in a dense mesh of marriage ties through which each group is united to many of the others. The Yolngu clan on the other hand is linked to far fewer groups, but by many marriage ties to each group. Members of two clans of the opposite moiety who are united by a persistent marriage alliance are political allies. Clans of the same moiety in a wife-bestower-wife- receiver relation (a relation of MM-ZDC, mdri-gutharra in the idiom of kinship) are often members of the same named clan-aggregate and are also political allies in some contexts”. Keen (1982, 2016) also notes how these webs of cross-cutting marriages between patrigroups map onto regional (often referred to as dialect) identities.

There are some sources that state a (Yolngu) ideology about marrying within the clan, such as this one from a senior Yolngu man: ""Marrying from another tribal clan is dishonouring to the clan group and will “mix” the descendant line. The purpose of both men and women under Ngarra marriage law is to continue the descendant line of the tribal clan […] A boyfriend or girlfriend from another clan is known as a “lubra” boyfriend or girlfriend. Having a lubra boyfriend or girlfriend is inappropriate and dangerous as it is a breach of Ngarra marriage law and a breach of kinship rules and offenders may be cursed. A lubra boyfriend or girlfriend may be seen as a prostitute."" (Gaymarani 2011: 290). However since clans are patrilineal this would mean marrying within the moiety which contravenes the marriage-outside-the-moiety ideology. Perhaps here ‘clan’ refers in fact to some higher level grouping or a different clan understood to provide marriage partners? In any case clan exogamy certainly is the norm in practice.

Regarding language group – for Burarra and Yolngu people, these are sometimes outside of linguistic group, but is not stated as an ideology. These are relatively large language groups, so this happens a bit less often than for some smaller language groups, but is still common enough. In the same Yolngu source as above though, Gaymarani states “A mixed marriage (Yolngu with non-Yolngu) will only cause one problem after another and there will be no sense of peace in the marriage” so perhaps these ideologies do exist at least on one side?

However since clans are patrilineal this would mean marrying within the moiety which contravenes the marriage-outside-the-moiety ideology. Perhaps here ‘clan’ refers in fact to some higher level grouping or a different clan understood to provide marriage partners? In any case clan exogamy certainly is the norm in practice.

Regarding language group – for Burarra and Yolngu people, these are sometimes outside of linguistic group, but is not stated as an ideology. These are relatively large language groups, so this happens a bit less often than for some smaller language groups, but is still common enough. In the same Yolngu source as above though, Gaymarani states “A mixed marriage (Yolngu with non-Yolngu) will only cause one problem after another and there will be no sense of peace in the marriage” so perhaps these ideologies do exist at least on one side? Of Keen’s (1982) account, McConvell (2013) says, “Keen, in keeping with the practice of most anthropologists (‘fictive closure’ In Denham’s terms) talks about Yolngu marriage (i.e. between Yolngu) and does not mention the fact that there are significant numbers of marriages between Yolngu and neighbouring groups, including the Burarra.”",Jill Vaughan,DEM,1,Binary-YesNo,Yes,No,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Vaughan,Burarra,Burarra,bvr,bura1267,Yolngu Matha,Yolngu Matha,yuul1335,yuul1239,Burara - Yolngu Matha,bvr-yuul1335,bura1267-yuul1239,North Australia,EK

Marrying out: When marrying each other, should [q2o1answer] people and [q2o2answer] people marry somebody outside their village or other kind of local community?",B,"Marriage rules dictate ideal marriage with designated skin (‘malk’) groups – subsections of the opposite moiety. This also means outside the clan group, since clans are patrilineal and therefore made up of people from the same moiety. Both groups have ideologies about which kin category is an ideal marriage. For Yolngu – “the ideal wife for a man is a woman classified as 'mother's brother's daughter', called galay (Warner 1969:43). An actual MBD is best, but if no-one of that near relationship is available, then one as near by blood as possible is preferred (1969:46); ""men marry a woman of their mother's clan who is their galay, and/or the daughter of a mukul rumaru of their mother's mother's clan or a classificatory mother's mother's clan"" (Keen 1978:110). For Burarra – “a man has rights in certain women as potential mothers-in-law. These are women to whom the man applies the kin term djabur, who are members of his mother's generation or alternate generations, and who are members of his mother's mother's patrilineal group, or whose own mother's mothers belong(ed) to the man's patrilineal group. Among a man's genealogically closest djabur, his MMBD, MMBSSD, FZDD and DDD are his potential mothers-in-law” (Keen 1982). These are all kin categories of the opposite moiety, and often result in close connections between clans linked by regular marriage links. As Keen (1982) summarises: “The Gidjingali [Burarra] community consists of a number of small patrilineal land-owning units linked together in a dense mesh of marriage ties through which each group is united to many of the others. The Yolngu clan on the other hand is linked to far fewer groups, but by many marriage ties to each group. Members of two clans of the opposite moiety who are united by a persistent marriage alliance are political allies. Clans of the same moiety in a wife-bestower-wife- receiver relation (a relation of MM-ZDC, mdri-gutharra in the idiom of kinship) are often members of the same named clan-aggregate and are also political allies in some contexts”. Keen (1982, 2016) also notes how these webs of cross-cutting marriages between patrigroups map onto regional (often referred to as dialect) identities.

There are some sources that state a (Yolngu) ideology about marrying within the clan, such as this one from a senior Yolngu man: ""Marrying from another tribal clan is dishonouring to the clan group and will “mix” the descendant line. The purpose of both men and women under Ngarra marriage law is to continue the descendant line of the tribal clan […] A boyfriend or girlfriend from another clan is known as a “lubra” boyfriend or girlfriend. Having a lubra boyfriend or girlfriend is inappropriate and dangerous as it is a breach of Ngarra marriage law and a breach of kinship rules and offenders may be cursed. A lubra boyfriend or girlfriend may be seen as a prostitute."" (Gaymarani 2011: 290).

– married Burarra men are expected to be generous in waiving their rights in women for the benefit of unmarried men. Yolngu men are not so much – older brothers are likely to marry most ‘claimable’ women
– the smaller Burarra patrilineal groups are not as effective as political units, providing little or no support for male members' claims in women, while larger Yolngu clans are able to provide effective support for members' claims

Finally, the visiting men whose mother's mothers were from the deceased's clan (Yan-nhangu men) have the special role of inspecting the work at the end of the preparation phase and approving it so the final phase of breaking up the deceased's bones and placing them in the hollow log can commence.

Do [q2o1answer] people and [q2o2answer] people marry each other, or have they done so in the past?",Yes,"Burarra and Yolngu people often marry outside of the clan group. As a result, marriages are often linguistically exogamous. This is one key factor that supports the region's high levels of multilingualism. 
The connections between clans are mediated by kinship categories, and therefore also marriage patterns between groups. Cultural guidelines exist for which clans are preferred as marriage partners (e.g. in Keen’s (1978) data on Yolngu marriages the mother’s clan accounts for nearly three-quarters of pairings). Marriage patterns are therefore quite localised and may or may not cross language boundaries. 
The Burarra and the Yolngu have somewhat distinct marriage practices. For example, traditionally the Yolngu were known to have more wives, continuing to marry additional wives throughout the lifespan (Keen 1978: 7). Relevant groups which are known to intermarry include the Yan-nhangu with the Maringa/Martay Burarra and the Djinang with the Gun-nartpa Burarra (i.e. the same pairs which are strongly connected in ceremonial exchange as described above) (e.g. (Bagshaw 1998; Elwell 1977; Bowern and James 2006).",Jill Vaughan,DFK,1,Binary-YesNo,Yes,No,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Vaughan,Burarra,Burarra,bvr,bura1267,Yolngu Matha,Yolngu Matha,yuul1368,yuul1239,Burara - Yolngu Matha,bvr-yuul1368,bura1267-yuul1239,North Australia,EK

While care is provided by all of the above categories, particularly important are mothers, mothers’ sisters, grandmothers and the peer group (from around age 2).  Young children are cared for by parents, especially mothers, mothers' sisters (who are considered mothers), grandmothers, other adults (most likely female), and older children. Researchers in northern Australia have noted the contemporary importance of the 'kid mob' – i.e. groups of children spending time together away from communal areas and from adult social activities – and this is assumed to have been the case pre-colonially also. Loakes et al (2013): ""In Indigenous Australian communities, older children not only play with and interact with younger children, but are also expected to take on some responsibility with respect to looking after them in the community. This means that for many older children, a large proportion of their daily interactions are likely to take place with other children"".
