In 1530, Malta was given as a fief to the Order or St. John by Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor and King of Spain. (Blouet 1967; Mack Smith 1968; Said-Zammit 2016; Brincat 2021). Malta had local jurisdictional/political organizations, including a council (università) that discussed issues pertaining to Malta. This council was also in contact with Sicily. (Blouet 1967: 45–46; Brincat 2021: 77–78; Said-Zammit 2016: 40) However, major political decisions were done by the foreign rulers and aristocracy. The catholic church was also an institution with major jurisdictional power, occasionally clashing with the Order over jurisdictional authority (Blouet 1967: 45–46, 89, 154–155; Said-Zammit 2016: 37–78). During the rule of the Order of St John, the municipal councils lost their power and the Order established a more centralised administration (Blouet 1967: 56; Said-Zammit 2016: 59).

1)    Tuscan Italian was likely the expected koine used in the time frame when most mixed marriages happened (approx. 1500–1800). 2
2)    Those Maltese who had most opportunities for out-group marriage lived in urban harbour cities and had daily contacts with foreigners and were not completely monolinguals. (Brincat 2021: 204–205.) 
3)    Maltese had become familiar with Sicilian before Tuscan Italian, and spoke Tuscan with Sicilian features (Brincat 2021: 205).
Ergo, Sicilian (or Tuscan Italian with very Sicilianate features) would have been the common language for both participants.
Other considerations: Both Maltese and Sicilians were Christians, and marriage is a sacrament, so Latin may have been a relevant language in marriage ceremonies.

What language do [q2o1answer] people expect to be used when working with [q2o2answer] people?,The [q2o2answer] language,"1) The Maltese who had most opportunities for working with Sicilians lived in urban harbour towns. Other groups, in addition to Sicilians, were present in the context of labour (see my comment to DLB01). These Maltese people had daily contacts with foreigners from different countries and were not completely monolinguals. 
2) Tuscan Italian was likely the expected koine used in labour (and other domains, too) since the harbor cities were multicultural and multilingual (cf. Brincat 2021: 204–205). 
3) Maltese had become familiar with Sicilian before Tuscan Italian and spoke Tuscan with Sicilian features (Brincat 2021: 205). 
Ergo, when working in multilingual settings, Maltese most likely would have used some sort of Tuscan (with code-switching maybe, depending on their level of fluency; see also my comment to DLB06) but I assume that when speaking with Sicilians specifically, both would have used Sicilian, since the Tuscan Italian that the Maltese spoke was already heavily influenced by Sicilian features.

In the rural areas, parishes were local focal points to smaller hamlets and villages (Said-Zammit 2016: 44, 55), while in the urban cities, neighbourhoods might have been the equivalent arena to daily interactions. Urban areas were somewhat segregated according to social class (cf. Said-Zammit 2016: 46, 49). In our timeframe, the importance of cities grows from 1500 onwards; in 1530 only 0,5% of the population lived in cities, by 1797 some 40% did. For example, Valletta had a population of 3400 in 1590, and 20,100 in 1797. (Brincat 2021: 219.) However, there is areal variation. It seems that especially those Maltese who had migrated to cities from rural areas modified their speech, suppressing distinct dialectal features and adapting the urban vernacular (Brincat 2021: 232–233). So, it is likely that Maltese spoke in an unmonitored way in their villages of origin, but not in the in the cities/larger urban centres.
